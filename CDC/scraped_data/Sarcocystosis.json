  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Sarcocystis hominis_ and _S. suihominis_ use humans as definitive hosts and\nare responsible for intestinal sarcocystosis in the human host. Humans may\nalso become dead-end hosts for non-human _Sarcocystis_ spp. after the\naccidental ingestion of oocysts.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/sarcocystosis/modules/Sarcocystis_LifeCycle_v3.gif?_=00580)\n\nBoth sporulated oocysts (containing two sporocysts) and individual sporocysts\ncan be passed in stool ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif).\nSporocysts contain four sporozoites and a refractile residual body. Sporocysts\ningested by the intermediate host (cattle for _S. hominis_ and pigs for _S.\nsuihominis_) rupture, releasing sporozoites. Sporozoites enter endothelial\ncells of blood vessels and undergo schizogony, resulting in first-generation\nschizonts. Merozoites derived from the first-generation invade small\ncapillaries and blood vessels, becoming second-generation schizonts. The\nsecond generation merozoites invade muscle cells and develop into sarcocysts\ncontaining bradyzoites, which are the infective stage for the definitive host\n![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_2.gif). Humans\nbecome infected when they eat undercooked meat containing these sarcocysts.\nBradyzoites are released from ruptured cysts in the small intestine ![The\nnumber\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_3.gif)\nand invade the lamina propria of the intestinal epithelium ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_4.gif).\nThere, they differentiate into macro- and microgametocytes. Fusion of male and\nfemale gametes ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif)\nresults in the formation of oocysts ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_6.gif).\nOocysts sporulate in the intestinal epithelium and are shed from the host in\nfeces ![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_7.gif).\nDue to the fragile nature of the oocyst wall, individual sporocysts may also\nbe detected in feces.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide, but more common in areas where livestock is raised.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nIn cases of intestinal sarcocystosis, when humans serve as the definitive\nhosts, infections are often asymptomatic and clear spontaneously.\nOccasionally, mild fever, diarrhea, chills, vomiting and respiratory problems\nmay occur. When humans become infected with sarcocysts of non-human species,\nthe infections are not intestinal but rather result in muscle cysts; symptoms\nsuch as myalgia, muscle weakness and transitory edema may occur. In these\ncases, humans are dead-end intermediate hosts.\n\n",

These non-human _Sarcocystis_ spp. will\nform structures known as sarcocysts in tissue; these sarcocysts contain\nnumerous bradyzoites.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nFor intestinal sarcocystosis caused by _S. hominis_ and _S. suihominis_ ,\ndiagnosis is made by the observation of oocysts or sporocysts in stool. They\nare easily overlooked as they are often shed in small numbers. Also, the two\nspecies cannot be separated by oocyst or sporocyst morphology. When humans\nserve as dead-end hosts for non-human Sarcocystis spp., diagnosis is made by\nthe finding of sarcocysts in tissue specimens.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n",
