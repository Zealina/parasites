  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nThe nematode (roundworm)_Angiostrongylus_(_=Parastrongylus_)_costaricensis_ is\nthe causal agent of abdominal angiostrongyliasis (intestinal\nangiostrongyliasis). The related species _A. cantonensis_(rat lungworm), which\ncauses neural angiostrongyliasis, is discussed\n[here](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_can/index.html).\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle image](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_cos/modules/Angio-\ncost_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=44001)](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_cos/modules/Angio-\ncost_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_cos/modules/Angio-\ncost_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nAdult worms of _A. costaricensis_ live in the ileocecal mesenteric arteries of\nthe rodent definitive host. Mature female wormsproduce eggs, which are carried\nthrough the circulation into intestinal wall capillaries, where larvae hatch\nand penetrate into the lumen of the ileum. These first-stage larvae are then\nshed in feces ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) and are\ningested by a suitable gastropod intermediate host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . After two molts, third-\nstage (L3) larvae are produced, which are infective to mammalian hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . When the gastropod is\ningested by the definitive host, the L3 larvae migrate to the lymphatic\nvessels of the abdominal cavity and develop into adults\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . Some L3 larvae may also\nbe shed into the environment by snails via slime trails, though it is not\nknown if ingestion of these larvae represents a major transmission route.\nThese young adults then migrate from the lymphatics to the mesenteric\narteries, where they become sexually mature, approximately 24 days after\nlarvae are ingested. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked\ngastropods that contain third-stage larvae or by eating food items\ncontaminated with gastropod tissue or perhaps larvae shed in slime\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . In humans, larvae\nundergo their usual migration and may reach sexual maturity and produce eggs\n(and L1 larvae) (unlike _A. cantonensis_)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . The presence of larvae,\nadult worms, and eggs causes a local inflammatory reaction in the intestinal\nwall. Parasites and eggs are usually degenerated by this host reaction, and\neggs do not appear to be shed in human stool.\n\n### Hosts\n\nThe main definitive host for _A. costaricensis_ is the hispid cotton rat\n(_Sigmodon hispidus_); but adult worms have been found in other rodent\nspecies, such as black rats (_Rattus rattus_), short-tailed zygodonts\n(_Zygodontomys_ _brevicauda_), spiny pocket mice (_Heteromys adspersus_), and\npygmy rice rats (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_). Slugs in the families\nVeronicellidae and Limacidae are the typical intermediate hosts.\n\nAberrant abdominal infections have been documented in humans, non-human\nprimates, and other mammals, including raccoons and one opossum.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nAbdominal angiostrongyliasis has mainly been reported from parts of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean. Although _A. costaricensis_ has been found in\nvarious animals in the southern United States, the sporadic human cases\nidentified in the United States are thought to have been travel associated.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe clinical manifestations of abdominal angiostrongyliasis (_A.\ncostaricensis_ infection) arise from the parasite’s invasion of the\ngastrointestinal wall, and may mimic those of other conditions, such as\nappendicitis, Crohn’s disease, or Meckel’s diverticulum. Eosinophilia is\ncommonly noted. Intestinal obstruction, perforation, and other complications\nmay occur, as may ectopic infection (e.g., in the liver).\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "_Angiostrongylus costaricensis_ eggs, larvae, and adults in tissue stained\nwith hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\n\nIn humans, _Angiostrongylus_ eggs and larvae remain sequestered in tissues and\ndo not appear to be excreted in stool. _A. costaricensis_ infections are\npredominantly abdominal; both eggs and larvae (occasionally adult worms) can\nbe identified in biopsy or surgical specimens of intestinal tissue, where the\neggs and larvae typically are engulfed in giant cells and/or granulomas.\n\nThe larvae of _A. costaricensis_ in tissue sections need to be distinguished\nfrom larvae of _Strongyloides_ . _A. costaricensis_ first-stage (L1) larvae\ntend to be slightly smaller in diameter than _S. stercoralis_ third-stage (L3)\nlarvae and have single lateral alae, whereas _S. stercoraliss_ L3 larvae have\nminute double lateral alae. The alae can be difficult to discern in most\nhistologic sections. However, the presence of granulomas containing thin-\nshelled eggs and/or larvae generally serves to distinguish _A. costaricensis_\ninfections from _Strongyloides_ infections.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_cos/images/1.1/A_cost_A.jpg?_=43937)\n\nFigure A: _Angiostrongylus costaricensis_ adults and eggs in intestinal tissue\nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of abdominal angiostrongyliasis (_A. costaricensis_ infection) is\nbased on finding eggs, larvae, or adult worms in histologic sections. The\npatient’s travel/exposure history may prompt consideration of the diagnosis.\n\n#### Molecular Diagnosis\n\nNo molecular tests specific for _A. costaricensis_ _are available_. However,\n_A. costaricensis_ can be identified in tissue by conventional PCR followed by\nDNA sequencing analysis.\n\n#### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions for the examination of histologic sections apply.\nInfectious L3 larvae are not encountered in a diagnostic laboratory setting.\n\n",
