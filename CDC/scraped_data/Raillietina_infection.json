  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Raillietina_ is a complex genus of cestodes (family Davaineidae) including\nhundreds of species described from a wide range of vertebrate hosts. It may\ncause rare accidental innocuous infections in humans. Most reports of\ninfections in humans are due to _R. celebensis_ and its many synonyms (e.g.\n_R. formosana, R. garrisoni, R. madagascariensis_). A few reports of _R.\ndemerariensis_ and _R. siriraji_ also exist _. Raillietina_ spp. can be\nmisidentified as [Inermicapsifer\nmadagascariensis](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/index.html) _._\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycleRaillietina_LifeCycle](/dpdx/raillietina/modules/Raillietina_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=41138)](/dpdx/raillietina/modules/Raillietina_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/raillietina/modules/Raillietina_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nMotile proglottids containing numerous egg capsules are shed in the definitive\nhost’s feces ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Arthropod\nintermediate hosts ingest proglottids or free egg capsules released as the\nproglottid breaks down in the environment\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Within the intermediate\nhost, oncospheres are released from the eggs and develop into cysticercoids\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The definitive host\nbecomes infected after ingesting intermediate hosts containing cysticercoids\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The scolex, armed with\ntwo rows of hammer-shaped hooks, everts and anchors to the small intestinal\nwall, where maturation to the adult stage occurs\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Aberrant human\ninfections may occur when infected arthropod intermediate hosts are ingested\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\nWhile the majority of _Raillietina_ spp. infect avian definitive hosts, the\nthree confirmed zoonotic species (_R. celebensis, R. demerariensis, R.\nsiriraji_) are natural parasites of rodents and not birds. _R. celebensis_ and\n_R. siriraji_ are primarily found in peridomestic rats (_Rattus norvegicus_\nand _R. rattus_), and also some other Southeast Asian murid rodents. _R.\ndemerariensis_ has been found in various Neotropical rodents and occasionally\nin monkeys.\n\nThe precise identity of the intermediate hosts for the zoonotic _Raillietina_\nspp. are unknown, but several species of ants, ground beetles (family\nCarabidae), scarab beetles (family Scarabaeidae), and darkling beetles (family\nTenebrionidae) serve as intermediate hosts for other _Raillietina_ spp.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Raillietina_ spp. occur broadly in animal hosts, but it is likely that a\nlimited number of these are zoonotic. _R. celebensis_ and _R. siriraji_ are\nbelieved to be exclusive to Asia and the Pacific region. Most known human\ncases of _Raillietina celebensis_ have occurred in East and Southeast Asia,\nthe Pacific islands, and once in Australia. _R. siriraji_ has been reported\nexclusively from Thailand. _R. demerariensis_ is a New World species, with\ncases described from isolated pockets in South America (primarily Ecuador),\nCentral America, and the Caribbean.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nIt is probable that most cases are asymptomatic; the presence of white, motile\nproglottids in the stool typically prompts clinical attention. However, among\npublished case reports, gastrointestinal disturbances and other vague\ncomplaints (e.g. irritability, nausea) have been described. Nearly all known\ncases have been from young children.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "**Raillietina _spp._ proglottids and egg capsules**\n\nAdult _Raillietina_ measure about 15–60 cm in length, with numerous\ntrapezoidal proglottids which become more round in shape towards the posterior\nregion of the strobila, creating a “beaded” appearance. Gravid proglottids\nwhich are shed in the feces are barrel-shaped, measure about 3 mm long, and\nare filled with egg capsules. The single genital pore is located in the\nanterior third of the lateral margin, though not readily visible in gravid\nproglottids. Egg capsules are polygonal in shape and have a transparent\nexterior zone with a darker interior zone; egg capsules of the known zoonotic\nspecies contains 1–4 eggs each.\n\n![Raillietina](/dpdx/raillietina/images/1/A.jpg?_=43096)\n\nFigure A: _Raillietina_ sp. proglottid from the stool of a human patient in\nMalaysia (bar = 1 mm).

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of _Raillietina_ spp. is based on the recovery and identification of\nproglottids, egg capsules, or scolices from the stool. Gravid proglottids and\negg capsules closely resemble those of _Inermicapsifer madagascariensis_.\nCareful examination of the genital pore and number of eggs within capsules may\nprovide some resolution of species, but requires morphological expertise. The\nrelevant reproductive features may be obscured by the abundant egg capsules in\n“ripe” proglottids shed in stool. Due to this challenge, the finding of only\nthe characteristic egg capsules/proglottids in many cases is most\nappropriately reported as “ _Inermicapsifer/Raillietina_ ”, in the absence of\nthe abovementioned identifiable discriminatory features.\n\nThe scolex, while seldom recovered, provides unequivocal distinction between\nthese two cestodes (armed rostellum in _Raillietina;_ unarmed and arostellar\nin _Inermicapsifer_). Further identification to _Raillietina_ species level is\ncomplex and requires considerable experience in cestode morphology.\n_Raillietina_ spp. proglottids have previously been mistakenly reported as\n_Dipylidium caninum._\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool samples apply. Infectious stages of _Raillietina_ spp. are\nnot encountered in laboratory diagnostic settings.\n\n",
