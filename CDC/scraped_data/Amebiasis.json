  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nSeveral protozoan species in the genus _Entamoeba_ colonize humans, but not\nall of them are associated with disease. _Entamoeba histolytica_ is well\nrecognized as a pathogenic ameba, associated with intestinal and\nextraintestinal infections. Other morphologically-identical _Entamoeba_ spp.,\nincluding _E. dispar, E. moshkovskii,_ and _E. bangladeshi,_ are generally not\nassociated with disease although investigations into pathogenic potential are\nongoing.\n\nWhile the discussed species are morphologically-identical, _E. histolytica_\nmay be observed with ingested red blood cells (erythrophagocytosis); _E.\ndispar_ may occasionally be seen with ingested erythrocytes as well, although\nits capacity for erythrophagocytosis is much less than that of _E.\nhistolytica_. [Non-pathogenic amebae ](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/index.html)(e.g.\n_Endolimax nana, I_ _odamoeba buetschlii,_ other _Entamoeba_ species) are\nimportant because they may be confused with _E. histolytica_ in diagnostic\ninvestigations.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Lifecycle\nimage](/dpdx/amebiasis/modules/Amebiasis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=98485)](/dpdx/amebiasis/modules/Amebiasis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/amebiasis/modules/Amebiasis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nCysts and trophozoites are passed in feces\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Cysts are typically\nfound in formed stool, whereas trophozoites are typically found in diarrheal\nstool. Infection with _Entamoeba histolytica_(and _E.dispar_) occurs via\ningestion of mature cysts ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg)\nfrom fecally contaminated food, water, or hands. Exposure to infectious cysts\nand trophozoites in fecal matter during sexual contact may also occur.\nExcystation ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) occurs in the\nsmall intestine and trophozoites\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) are released, which\nmigrate to the large intestine. Trophozoites may remain confined to the\nintestinal lumen (A: noninvasive infection) with individuals continuing to\npass cysts in their stool (asymptomatic carriers). Trophozoites can invade the\nintestinal mucosa (B: intestinal disease), or blood vessels, reaching\nextraintestinal sites such as the liver, brain, and lungs (C: extraintestinal\ndisease). Trophozoites multiply by binary fission and produce cysts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) , and both stages are\npassed in the feces ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) .\nCysts can survive days to weeks in the external environment and remain\ninfectious in the environment due to the protection conferred by their walls.\nTrophozoites passed in the stool are rapidly destroyed once outside the body,\nand if ingested would not survive exposure to the gastric environment.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nPathogenic _Entamoeba_ species occur worldwide and are frequently recovered\nfrom fresh water contaminated with human feces. The majority of amebiasis\ncases occur in developing countries.\n\nIn industrialized countries, risk groups include men who have sex with men,\ntravelers, recent immigrants, immunocompromised persons, and institutionalized\npopulations.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe majority of infections restricted to the lumen of the intestine (“luminal\namebiasis”) are asymptomatic. Amebic colitis, or invasive intestinal\namebiasis, occurs when the mucosa is invaded. Symptoms include severe\ndysentery and associated complications. Severe chronic infections may lead to\nfurther complications such as peritonitis, perforations, and the formation of\namebic granulomas (ameboma).\n\nAmebic liver abscesses are the most common manifestation of extraintestinal\namebiasis. Pleuropulmonary abscess, brain abscess, and necrotic lesions on the\nperianal skin and genitalia have also been observed.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n#### Differential diagnosis among other amebae\n\nPathogenic _Entamoeba_ _species_ must be differentiated from other intestinal\nprotozoa such as the [nonpathogenic amebae](/dpdx/intestinalAmebae/index.html)\n(_Entamoeba coli_ , _E. hartmanni_ , _E. gingivalis_ , _Endolimax nana_ ,\n_Iodamoeba buetschlii_ _)_ and the flagellate [_Dientamoeba\nfragilis_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/dientamoeba/index.html). Morphologic\ndifferentiation among these is possible, but potentially complicated, based on\nmorphologic characteristics of the cysts and trophozoites.\n\nIn culture, differential growth characteristics of _E. moshkovskii_ may aid in\ndistinguishing it from other species, but culture methods have important\nlimitations (missing mixed infections, contamination, labor-intensive, limited\navailability). Historically, differentiation _of_ _E. dispar_ and _E.\nhistolytica_ was based on isoenzymatic or immunologic analysis, but these are\nno longer favored with the availability of effective molecular methods and are\nseldom performed. Molecular methods are currently recommended for\ndistinguishing pathogenic _Entamoeba_ species.\n\n#### Microscopic Detection\n\nMicroscopic identification of cysts and trophozoites in the stool is the\ncommon method for diagnosing _pathogenic_ _Entamoeba_ _species_. This can be\naccomplished using:\n\n  * Fresh stool: wet mounts and permanently stained preparations (e.g., trichrome).\n  * Concentrates from fresh stool: wet mounts, with or without iodine stain, and permanently stained preparations (e.g., trichrome). While useful for cysts, concentration methods may not be useful for demonstrating trophozoites.\n  * Microscopy also has a low sensitivity if only one stool sample is analyzed, and requires personnel trained in morphological diagnosis. Collection and analysis of three consecutive stool samples within ten days improves the chances for detection. _Also,__E. dispar_ , _E. histolytica,__and_ _E. moshkovskii_ are not distinguishable based on morphology.\n\nTrophozoites can also be identified in aspirates or biopsy samples obtained\nduring colonoscopy or surgery.\n\n#### Immunodiagnosis\n\nEnzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits for _Entamoeba histolytica_ antibody detection\nas well as EIA kits for antigen detection are commercially available in the\nUnited States. Antibody detection is most useful in patients with\nextraintestinal disease (i.e., amebic liver abscess) when organisms are not\ngenerally found on stool examination. Antibody detection is of limited\ndiagnostic value on patients from highly endemic areas that are likely to have\nprior exposure and seroconversion, but may be of more use on patients from\nareas where pathogenic _Entamoeba_ spp. are rare. Antigen detection during\nactive infections may be useful as an adjunct to microscopic diagnosis in\ndetecting parasites and can distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic\ninfections.\n\n##### **Antibody detection**\n\nThe indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test has been replaced by commercially\navailable EIA test kits for routine serodiagnosis of amebiasis. Antigen\nconsists of a crude soluble extract of axenically cultured organisms. The EIA\ntest detects antibody specific for _E. histolytica_ in approximately 95% of\npatients with extraintestinal amebiasis, 70% of patients with active\nintestinal infection, and 10% of asymptomatic persons who are passing cysts of\n_E. histolytica_. If antibodies are not detectable in patients with an acute\npresentation of suspected amebic liver abscess, a second specimen should be\ndrawn 7-10 days later. If the second specimen does not show seroconversion,\nother agents should be considered. Detectable _E. histolytica_ -specific\nantibodies may persist for years after successful treatment, so the presence\nof antibodies does not necessarily indicate acute or current infection. Also,\npatients who have lived in highly endemic areas are likely to be seropositive\ndue to past exposures. Specificity is 95% or higher: false-positive reactions\nrarely occur.\n\nAlthough detection of IgM antibodies specific for _E. histolytica_ has been\nreported, sensitivity is only about 64% in patients with current invasive\ndisease. Several commercial EIA kits for antibody detection are available in\nthe United States. No commercial antibody detection kits exist for _E. dispar_\nor _E. moshkovskii_ or _E. bangladeshi_.\n\n##### **Antigen Detection**\n\nAntigen detection may be useful as an adjunct to microscopic diagnosis in\ndetecting parasites and to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic\ninfections. However, utility is limited for frozen or fixed specimens and for\npost-treatment specimens. Recent studies indicate improved sensitivity and\nspecificity of fecal antigen assays with the use of monoclonal antibodies\nwhich can distinguish between _E. histolytica_ and _E. dispar_ infections. At\nleast one commercial kit is available which detects only pathogenic _E.\nhistolytica_ infection in stool; several kits are available which detect _E.\nhistolytica_ antigens in stool but do not exclude _E. dispar_ infections.\n\n#### Molecular Diagnosis\n\n**Conventional PCR**\n\nIn reference diagnosis laboratories, molecular analysis by conventional PCR-\nbased assays is the method of choice for discriminating between _E.\nhistolytica_ and _E. dispar_. Some assays also can distinguish _E.\nmoshkovskii._\n\n**Real-Time PCR**\n\nA TaqMan real-time PCR approach has been validated at CDC and is used for\ndifferential laboratory diagnosis of amebiasis. The assay targets the 18S rRNA\ngene with species-specific TaqMan probes in a duplex format, making it\npossible to detect both _E. histolyrica_ and _E. dispar_ in the same reaction\nvessel.\n\n**References:**  \nQvarnstrom Y, James C, Xayavong M, Holloway B, Moura I, Visvesvara GS, et al.\nComparison of real-time PCR rationales for differential laboratory diagnosis\nof amebiasis.
