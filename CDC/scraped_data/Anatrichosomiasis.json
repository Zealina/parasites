  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Anatrichosoma_ is a genus of poorly understood tissue-dwelling nematodes that\nvery rarely infect humans. They are generally associated with wild primate,\nrodent, and marsupial hosts, and share some morphologic similarities with\nother trichuroids such as _Trichuris_ and _Capillaria._ Zoonotic infections\nhave so far never been unequivocally identified to species level.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Life\nCycle](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/modules/Anatrichosoma_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=41709)](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/modules/Anatrichosoma_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/modules/Anatrichosoma_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nThe complete life cycle of _Anatrichosoma_ spp. is unknown. The long, slender\nadults are found in tunnels in mucosal and squamous epithelial tissues of\ndefinitive hosts such as primates and marsupials\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) ; the particular anatomic\nsite (e.g. skin, nasal/sinus cavity, mouth) is dependent on parasite species\nand males may be found in deeper layers of tissue than females. After\ncopulation, the gravid females release embryonated eggs into the surrounding\ntissue, which are shed in mucosal secretions or eventually swallowed and shed\nin feces ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . From that\npoint, it is not known whether _Anatrichosoma_ spp. follow an indirect cycle\nwith intermediate host(s) ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg)\nor a direct cycle without additional hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . Larval stages beyond\nwhat is present in eggs have not been identified, and experimental infections\nof potential intermediate hosts (e.g. beetles, cockroaches) have never\nsucceeded.\n\nThe transmission route to humans is not known\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . In one instance, two\npatients had skin exposure to snails but it is not known if snails play a role\nin the _Anatrichosoma_ life cycle.\n\n### Hosts\n\nSeveral _Anatrichosoma_ spp. (_A. cutaneum_ , _A._ _cynomolgi, A. nacepobi, A.\nrhina_) have been described from subcutaneous tissues of various Old World\nprimates. Non-primate associated species include _A. ocularis_ of common tree\nshrews (_Tupaia glis_), _A. gerbilis_ of North African gerbils (_Gerbillus\ncampestris_), _A. haycocki_ of dasyurid marsupials, and _A. buccalis_ of\nopossums (_Didelphis virginiana_). Aberrant infections may infrequently occur\nin humans, and occasionally occur in domestic dogs and cats.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Anatrichosoma_ spp. have been found in a variety of locations in wildlife\nhosts but their broader occurrence is poorly understood. Zoonotic cases have\nbeen reported from Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Italy, and in a few patients from\nthe United States with recent travel to Mexico.\n\n### Clinical Manifestations\n\nIn the few known human cases, clinical manifestations have involved the\ndevelopment of cutaneous or mucosal lesions caused by the presence of adult\nworms. Inflammatory tracks resembling cutaneous larva migrans/creeping\neruption on the limbs, nodule formation, and ulceration of the oral mucosa\nhave been described.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "**_Anatrichosoma_****sp. adult**\n\n_Anatrichosoma_ spp. are long and slender (both sexes up to ~30 mm long;\nfemales ~0.7 mm and males ~0.25 mm maximum width). Among nematodes, this group\nis unusual in that the male may be as long as the female, but is always more\nslender. Males also lack spicules and an ejaculatory duct. Eggs are barrel-\nshaped with two polar plugs and a coarsely striated shell, and are embryonated\nwhen passed.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/images/1/1A.jpg?_=41768)\n\nFigure A: _Anatrichosoma_ sp. adult female from a naturally infected brown\nfour-eyed opossum (_Metachirus nudicaudatus_), Ecuador. Note the very fine,\nattenuated posterior and gently tapering body.\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/images/1/1B.jpg?_=41769)\n\nFigure B: Anterior region of the specimen shown in figure A. Numerous\nstichocytes (darts) are present, similar to related genera such as _Trichuris_\nand _Capillaria_.\n\n![Figure C](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/images/1/1C.jpg?_=41770)\n\nFigure C: View of the vaginal and uterine region of the specimen in figure A\nabove. The vulva (arrow) is generally in the anterior portion of the body;\nmature eggs are seen in the anterior uterus (dart). Immature eggs are also\nvisible in the more posterior region of the uterus (asterisk).\n\n**_Anatrichosoma_****sp. in tissue**\n\nMost human cases of anatrichosomiasis have been identified via histological\nsections. In addition to the typical trichuroid stichosome, characteristic\nfeatures include the minute size, paired bacillary bands, a single uterine\ntube, and embryonated eggs in utero and in surrounding tissue.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/images/2/2A.jpg?_=41799)\n\nFigure A: Cross sections of _Anatrichosoma_ sp. (presumed _A. buccalis_)\nfemales in buccal tissue from an opossum, H&E stained.

Note the single uterine\ntube (bottom, arrow) with developing eggs, and the minute intestinal tube\n(top, dart).\n\n![Figure C](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/images/2/2C.jpg?_=41801)\n\nFigure C: Cross-sections of a coiled _Anatrichosoma_ sp. in the subcutaneous\ntissues of a Patas monkey (_Erythrocebus patas_).\n\n![Figure D](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/images/2/2D.jpg?_=41802)\n\nFigure D: Closer view of cross sections of male _Anatrichosoma_ sp., showing\nthe characteristic paired, dark-staining bacillary bands (arrows) which are\nvisible in many sections (diameter ~70 µm).\n\n![Figure E](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/images/2/2E.jpg?_=41803)\n\nFigure E: _Anatrichosoma_ sp. egg in tissue, showing the presence of polar\nplugs (arrows), a striated shell (dart), and coiled larva.\n\n![Figure E](/dpdx/anatrichosoma/images/2/2F.jpg?_=41804)\n\nFigure F: _Anatrichosoma_ sp. egg in tissue. The higher focal plane shows the\nstriated surface texture (arrow) of the shell (overall egg size ~70 µm long).\n\n",
  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis depends on the identification of adult _Anatrichosoma_ spp. and eggs\nin tissue. Though this group possesses some distinct features visible in\nhistological sections, it must be carefully distinguished from other nematodes\nthat are morphologically similar (e.g. _Trichuris_ ,_Capillaria_) or that may\nappear in similar subcutaneous sites (e.g. _Gongylonema, Dirofilaria_)_._\nMolecular identification may be attempted on tissue specimens although this\nhas not yet been successful in clinical cases.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/other/tissue.html) apply for\nthe processing of tissue specimens.\n\n",
