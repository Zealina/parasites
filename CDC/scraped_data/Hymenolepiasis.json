  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nHymenolepiasis is caused by two cestodes (tapeworm) species, _Hymenolepis\nnana_ (the dwarf tapeworm, adults measuring 15 to 40 mm in length) and\n_Hymenolepis diminuta_ (rat tapeworm, adults measuring 20 to 60 cm in length).\n_Hymenolepis diminuta_ is a cestode of rodents infrequently seen in humans and\nfrequently found in rodents.\n\nLife Cycles\n\n#### _Hymenolepis nana_\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/hymenolepiasis/modules/H_nana_LifeCycle.gif?_=01675)\n\nEggs of _Hymenolepis nana_ are immediately infective when passed with the\nstool and cannot survive more than 10 days in the external environment ![The\nnumber\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif).\nWhen eggs are ingested by an arthropod intermediate host ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_2.gif) (various\nspecies of beetles and fleas may serve as intermediate hosts), they develop\ninto cysticercoids, which can infect humans or rodents upon ingestion ![The\nnumber 3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_3.gif)\nand develop into adults in the small intestine. A morphologically identical\nvariant, _H. nana_ var. _fraterna_ , infects rodents and uses arthropods as\nintermediate hosts. When eggs are ingested ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_4.gif) (in\ncontaminated food or water or from hands contaminated with feces), the\noncospheres contained in the eggs are released. The oncospheres (hexacanth\nlarvae) penetrate the intestinal villus and develop into cysticercoid larvae\n![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif).\nUpon rupture of the villus, the cysticercoids return to the intestinal lumen,\nevaginate their scoleces ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_6.gif),\nattach to the intestinal mucosa and develop into adults that reside in the\nileal portion of the small intestine producing gravid proglottids ![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_7.gif).\nEggs are passed in the stool when released from proglottids through its\ngenital atrium or when proglottids disintegrate in the small intestine ![The\nnumber\n8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_8.gif).\nAn alternate mode of infection consists of internal autoinfection, where the\neggs release their hexacanth embryo, which penetrates the villus continuing\nthe infective cycle without passage through the external environment ![The\nnumber\n9](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_9.gif).\nThe life span of adult worms is 4 to 6 weeks, but internal autoinfection\nallows the infection to persist for years.\n\n#### _Hymenolepis diminuta_\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/hymenolepiasis/modules/H_diminuta_LifeCycle.gif?_=01676)\n\nEggs of _Hymenolepis diminuta_ are passed out in the feces of the infected\ndefinitive host (rodents, man) ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif).\nThe mature eggs are ingested by an intermediate host (various arthropod adults\nor larvae) ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif), and\noncospheres are released from the eggs and penetrate the intestinal wall of\nthe host ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif), which\ndevelop into cysticercoid larvae. Species from the genus _Tribolium_ are\ncommon intermediate hosts for _H. diminuta_. The cysticercoid larvae persist\nthrough the arthropod’s morphogenesis to adulthood. _H. diminuta_ infection is\nacquired by the mammalian host after ingestion of an intermediate host\ncarrying the cysticercoid larvae ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_4.gif). Humans\ncan be accidentally infected through the ingestion of insects in precooked\ncereals, or other food items, and directly from the environment (e.g., oral\nexploration of the environment by children). After ingestion, the tissue of\nthe infected arthropod is digested releasing the cysticercoid larvae in the\nstomach and small intestine. Eversion of the scoleces ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif)\noccurs shortly after the cysticercoid larvae are released. Using the four\nsuckers on the scolex, the parasite attaches to the small intestine wall.\nMaturation of the parasites occurs within 20 days and the adult worms can\nreach an average of 30 cm in length ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_6.gif).\nEggs are released in the small intestine from gravid proglottids ![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_7.gif)\nthat disintegrate after breaking off from the adult worms. The eggs are\nexpelled to the environment in the mammalian host’s feces ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Hymenolepis nana_ is the most common cause of all cestode infections, and is\nencountered worldwide. In temperate areas its incidence is higher in children\nand institutionalized groups. _Hymenolepis diminuta_ , while less frequent,\nhas been reported from various areas of the world.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n_Hymenolepis nana_ and _H. diminuta_ infections are most often asymptomatic.\nHeavy infections with _H. nana_ can cause weakness, headaches, anorexia,\nabdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n\n",

In this image, two\nof the suckers and the rostellar hooks are clearly visible.\n\n##### Intermediate hosts of _Hymenolepis_ spp.\n\nArthropods, especially beetles, serve as intermediate hosts for _Hymenolepis_\nspp. The arthropod intermediate host is required for _H. diminuta_ , but not\n_H. nana_ , and humans can become infected with the latter by direct ingestion\nof eggs. Within the arthropod host, the eggs develop into cysticeroids, which\ncan infect the mammalian host upon ingestion and develop into adults in the\nsmall intestine.\n\n![](/dpdx/hymenolepiasis/images/6/Tribolium_confusum1.jpg?_=01702)\n\nFigure A: _Tribolium confusum_ , a common intermediate host for _Hymenolepis_\nspp. _Tribolium_ and related genera breed in cereals, grains, and grain-based\nsnack foods and are easily ingested by humans and rodents. Since these food\nproducts are usually not heated prior to consumption, cysticeroids within the\nbeetles remain viable and infective.
