  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n“African trypanosomes” or “Old World trypanosomes” are protozoan\nhemoflagellates of the genus _Trypanosoma,_ in the subgenus _Trypanozoon_. Two\nsubspecies that are morphologically indistinguishable cause distinct disease\npatterns in humans: _T. b. gambiense_ , causing chronic African\ntrypanosomiasis (“West African sleeping sickness”) and _T. b. rhodesiense_ ,\ncausing acute African trypanosomiasis (“East African sleeping sickness”). The\nthird subspecies _T. b. brucei_ is a parasite primarily of cattle and\noccasionally other animals, and under normal conditions does not infect\nhumans.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/trypanosomiasisafrican/modules/SleepingSick_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=41950)](/dpdx/trypanosomiasisafrican/modules/SleepingSick_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View\nLarger](/dpdx/trypanosomiasisafrican/modules/SleepingSick_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nDuring a blood meal on the mammalian host, an infected tsetse fly (genus\n_Glossina_) injects metacyclic trypomastigotes into skin tissue. The parasites\nenter the lymphatic system and pass into the bloodstream\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Inside the host, they\ntransform into bloodstream trypomastigotes\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) , are carried to other\nsites throughout the body, reach other body fluids (e.g., lymph, spinal\nfluid), and continue the replication by binary fission\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The entire life cycle of\nAfrican trypanosomes is represented by extracellular stages. The tsetse fly\nbecomes infected with bloodstream trypomastigotes when taking a blood meal on\nan infected mammalian host ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg)\n, ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . In the fly’s midgut,\nthe parasites transform into procyclic trypomastigotes, multiply by binary\nfission ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) , leave the\nmidgut, and transform into epimastigotes\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . The epimastigotes reach\nthe fly’s salivary glands and continue multiplication by binary fission\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) . The cycle in the fly\ntakes approximately 3 weeks. Rarely, _T. b. gambiense_ may be acquired\ncongenitally if the mother is infected during pregnancy.\n\n### Hosts and Vectors\n\nHumans are considered the main reservoir for _Trypanosoma brucei gambiense_ ,\nbut this species can also be found in animals, including primates and\nungulates. Domestic cattle are thought to be the most epidemiologically-\nrelevant animal reservoir of _T. b. rhodesiense_. The only known vector for\neach is the tsetse fly (_Glossina_ spp.).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_T. b. gambiense_ is endemic in West and Central Africa. _T. b. rhodesiense_\nis restricted to East and Southeast Africa. These ranges do not overlap,\nalthough in Uganda both subspecies are co-endemic, with _T. b. gambiense_\nfound near the northern border and _T. b. rhodesiense_ is found in the central\nand southern regions of that country.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nInfection occurs in two stages which may sometimes be preceded by the\ndevelopment of a trypanosomal chancre on the site of inoculation within days\nof being bitten by an infected fly (most commonly occurs with _T. b.\nrhodesiense_). First-stage disease (haemolymphatic) involves nonspecific signs\nand symptoms such as intermittent fever, pruritus and lymphadenopathy.\nPosterior triangle cervical lymphadenopathy, or “Winterbottom’s sign” is\ncommonly seen in _T. b. gambiense_ infections, but lymphadenopathy can also be\nseen in the axillar, inguinal and epitrochlear regions. Enlarged lymph nodes\ntend to be submandibular, axillary and inguinal in _T. b. rhodesiense_.\n\nIn the second-stage disease (meningoencephalitic), invasion of the central\nnervous system causes a variety of neuropsychiatric manifestations including\nsleep disorders, hence the common name “African sleeping sickness”. Severe\ncardiac involvement with electrocardiogram abnormalities consistent with\nperimyocarditis are also observed. These alterations are generally mild in in\n_T. b. gambiense infections_ but are more severe and appear earlier in _T. b.\nrhodesiense_ infections _._ The course of infection is much more acute and\nrapid with _T. b. rhodesiense_ than _T. b. gambien_ _se,_ and both infections\nare almost invariably fatal without treatment.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis rests upon demonstrating trypanosomes by microscopic examination\nof chancre fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, bone marrow, or, in the late\nstages of infection, cerebrospinal fluid. A wet preparation should be examined\nfor the motile trypanosomes, and in addition a blood smear (thin or thick)\nshould be fixed, stained with Giemsa (or Field), and examined. Concentration\ntechniques can be used prior to microscopic examination. For blood samples,\nthese include centrifugation followed by examination of the buffy coat; mini\nanion-exchange/centrifugation; and the Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC)\ntechnique. For other samples such as spinal fluid, concentration techniques\ninclude centrifugation followed by examination of the sediment. Isolation of\nthe parasite by inoculation of rats or mice is a sensitive method, but its use\nis limited to _T. b. rhodesiense_.\n\n**Antibody Detection**\n\nRapid tests for _T. b. gambiense_ are used for the screening of whole blood\nfor control/elimination ; performance is variable depending on endemicity.\nSeveral of these kits are commercially available and include dipstick and card\nagglutination formats. However, with _T. b. rhodesiense_ , seroconversion\noccurs after the onset of clinical symptoms and thus antibody detection is of\nlimited use.\n\n**Molecular Detection**\n\nNo nucleic acid-based tests are validated for the diagnosis of African\ntrypanosomiasis, and diagnostic performance varies considerably among these\ntests.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard safety protocols for handling blood and sharps\n([https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/blood/safety.html](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/blood/safety.html)).\nAs with all bloodborne pathogens, precautions need to be taken to reduce risk\nof needle sticks or other exposures. At least one report of laboratory-\nacquired African trypanosomiasis exists, in a technician that experienced a\nneedle stick while inoculating animals .\n\n_The CDC currently does not offer any serologic or molecular tests for African\ntrypanosomiasis._\n\n",
