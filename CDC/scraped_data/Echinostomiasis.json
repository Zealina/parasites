  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe trematode family Echinostomatidae includes numerous spiny-collared\nintestinal flukes known to infect humans. Infections are documented mostly\nfrom members of the genera **_Echinostoma_** (_E. hortense_ , _E. trivolvis,\nE. macrorchis_ , _E. revolutum_ sensu lato,_E. ilocanum, E. cinetorchis, E.\nechinatum_[= _lindoense_]) and _E. fujianensis_)_._ Sporadic infections with\nmembers of other echinostomid genera (including _Echinoparyphium_ _,\nAcanthoparyphium, Artyfechinostomum, Episthmium_ , _Himasthla, Hypoderaeum,_\nand _Isthmiophora_) are known _._ The taxonomy of this group at large is\npoorly understood and molecular data are scarce, thus genus/species names and\nassignments are liable to change in coming years.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/modules/Echinostoma_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=37123)](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/modules/Echinostoma_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/modules/Echinostoma_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nLike many trematodes, echinostomid flukes undergo a multi-host (indirect) life\ncycle . Unembryonated eggs are passed in feces of infected definitive hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) and develop in water\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Miracidia usually take\nabout 3 weeks to mature before hatching\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) , after which they swim\nfreely and penetrate the first intermediate host, a snail\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The intramolluscan\nstages include a sporocyst stage\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4a.jpg) , one or two generations\nof rediae ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4b.jpg) , and cercariae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4c.jpg) , which are released from\nthe snail. The cercariae may encyst as metacercariae within the same first\nintermediate host or leave the host and penetrate a new second intermediate\nhost ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . The definitive host\nbecomes infected after eating metacercariae in infected second intermediate\nhosts ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . Metacercariae\nexcyst in the duodenum ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) and\nadults reside in the small intestine (for some species, occasionally in the\nbile ducts or large intestine)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\nMany animals including birds, carnivores, rodents, and humans may serve as\ndefinitive hosts for various echinostomid species. The most frequently\nencountered zoonotic species, _Echinostoma hortense_ and _E. revolutum_ sensu\nlato, are usually associated with mammalian (rat, dog) and avian definitive\nhosts, respectively. The first intermediate host is always a snail (families\nPlanorbidae, Lymnaeidae, and Bulinidae), and the major competent intermediate\nhosts vary by parasite species. Also depending on species, several animals may\nserve as the second intermediate host, including other snails, bivalves, fish,\nsalamanders, and tadpoles.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nEchinostomes occur in wildlife and domestic animals worldwide, but human cases\nare seen most frequently in Southeast and East Asia. Incidence is highest in\nareas where undercooked or raw freshwater snails, clams, fish, or amphibians\nare eaten.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nPathogenicity likely varies depending on the infecting species. Catarrhal\ninflammation often occurs due to the penetration of the sharp-spined collar\ninto the intestinal mucosa, which creates ulcerative lesions. In heavy\ninfections, gastrointestinal signs/symptoms may occur. Peripheral eosinophilia\nis usually present. A small number of fatal cases of _Artyfechinostomum_(=\n_Echinostoma_) _malayanum_ , in which heavy worm burdens caused anemia,\nmalnutrition, or intestinal perforation, have been reported.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### _Echinostomid_ egg in wet mounts.\n\nEchinostomid eggs have a wide size range depending on the species and may\nrange from 80–135 µm long by 55–80 µm wide. They have an inconspicuous\noperculum and the abopercular end is often thickened. The larger eggs are very\nsimilar to _Fasciola_ and _Fasciolopsis_. Eggs are passed unembryonated in\nfeces.\n\n![Figure\nA](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/images/1/Echinostoma_egg_dog_BAM1.jpg?_=04251)\n\nFigure A: Echinostomid egg in an unstained wet mount of stool. Image taken at\n400x magnification.\n\n##### _Echinostoma_ spp. adults.\n\nEchinostomid flukes are much longer than wide and measure about 2–10 mm long\nby 1–2 mm wide, depending on the species. The oral sucker is surrounded by a\ncollar of spines, the number of which varies among species. The oral and\nventral suckers are located fairly close to one another. A single ovary is\nsituated near the large, paired testes. Adults reside in the small intestine\nof the definitive host.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/images/2/Echino_Label_New.jpg?_=01864)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _E. revolutum_ , stained with carmine. Structures\nillustrated in this figure include: oral sucker (OS), armed collar (CL),\ncirrus sac (CS), ventral sucker, or acetabulum (VS), uterus containing eggs\n(UT), ovary (OV), paired testes (TE), and vitelline glands (VT).\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/images/2/Echino_Collar.jpg?_=01863)\n\nFigure B: A closer view of the anterior region of the _E. revolutum_ specimen\nshown in Figure A. The distinctive collar bears many spines (arrows), and\nsurrounds the oral sucker/aperture (dart).\n\n##### _Echinostomid_ in tissue, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\n\nThe following images were taken from an adult echinostomid removed from a\ncolon polyp during routine colonoscopy.\n\n![](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/images/3/Echinostoma_tissue_BAM1.jpg?_=04268)\n\nFigure A: Adult _Echinostoma_ removed during a colonoscopy, stained with\nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\n\n![Figure\nD](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/images/3/Echinostoma_tissue_BAM4.jpg?_=04267)\n\nFigure D: Higher magnification of the specimen in Figures A–C. Shown here are\neggs (EG) within the size range for _Echinostoma_ spp. (roughly 100\nmicrometers in length, taking into account they are sections and may not be\ncut in a perfect horizontal plane).\n\n![](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/images/3/Echinostoma_tissue_BAM2.jpg?_=04265)\n\nFigure B:Higher magnification of the anterior end of the specimen in Figure A.\nNotice the acetabulum (ventral sucker, AC).\n\n![](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/images/3/Echinostoma_tissue_BAM3.jpg?_=04270)\n\nFigure C:Higher magnification of the posterior end of the specimen in Figure\nA. Notice the vitelline glands (VT) and lobed testes (TE).\n\n##### Intermediate hosts of _Echinostomatidae_\n\nLike all trematodes, echinostomids require a snail as a first intermediate\nhost. The second intermediate host may also be a snail, sometimes the same\nindividual snail that served as the first intermediate host. Due to the large\ngeographic distribution of echinostomes, and the many species present, there\nare many species of snails that may serve as first or second intermediate\nhosts. Other second intermediate hosts include bivalves, fish, salamanders,\nand tadpoles.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/echinostomiasis/images/4/Lymnaea_Conchology_A.jpg?_=04256)\n\nFigure A: _Lymnaea_ sp.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is based on microscopic identification of eggs in the stool. Because\nthe eggs are large, careful measurements must be taken to avoid confusion with\nthe eggs of _Fasciola_ , _Fasciolopsis,__and_ _Gastrodiscoides_. Genus- and\nspecies-level identification cannot be done based on egg morphology and adults\nare needed for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n### Morphology\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparisons with other intestinal\nparasites](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions for the processing of [stool\nsamples](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) apply . Echinostomid\neggs are not infectious to humans.\n\n",
