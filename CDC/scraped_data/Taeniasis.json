  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe cestodes _Taenia saginata_ (beef tapeworm), _T. solium_ (pork tapeworm)\nand _T. asiatica_ (Asian tapeworm). _Taenia solium_ can also cause\ncysticercosis.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n  \n![lifecycle](/dpdx/taeniasis/modules/Taenia_LifeCycle.gif?_=96656)\n\nTaeniasis is the infection of humans with the adult tapeworm of _Taenia\nsaginata_ , _T. solium_ or _T. asiatica_. Humans are the only definitive hosts\nfor these three species. Eggs or gravid proglottids are passed with feces\n![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif);\nthe eggs can survive for days to months in the environment. Cattle (_T.\nsaginata_) and pigs (_T. solium_ and _T. asiatica_) become infected by\ningesting vegetation contaminated with eggs or gravid proglottids ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif). In the\nanimalâ€™s intestine, the oncospheres hatch ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif), invade\nthe intestinal wall, and migrate to the striated muscles, where they develop\ninto cysticerci. A cysticercus can survive for several years in the animal.\nHumans become infected by ingesting raw or undercooked infected meat ![The\nnumber 4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_4.gif).\nIn the human intestine, the cysticercus develops over 2 months into an adult\ntapeworm, which can survive for years. The adult tapeworms attach to the small\nintestine by their scolex ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif)\nand reside in the small intestine ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_6.gif).\nLength of adult worms is usually 5 m or less for _T. saginata_ (however it may\nreach up to 25 m) and 2 to 7 m for _T. solium_. The adults produce proglottids\nwhich mature, become gravid, detach from the tapeworm, and migrate to the anus\nor are passed in the stool (approximately 6 per day). _T. saginata_ adults\nusually have 1,000 to 2,000 proglottids, while _T. solium_ adults have an\naverage of 1,000 proglottids. The eggs contained in the gravid proglottids are\nreleased after the proglottids are passed with the feces. _T. saginata_ may\nproduce up to 100,000 and _T. solium_ may produce 50,000 eggs per proglottid\nrespectively.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Taenia saginata_ and _T. solium_ are worldwide in distribution. _Taenia\nsolium_ is more prevalent in poorer communities where humans live in close\ncontact with pigs and eat undercooked pork. _Taenia asiatica_ is limited to\nAsia and is seen mostly in the Republic of Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia,\nand Thailand.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n_Taenia saginata_ taeniasis produces only mild abdominal symptoms. The most\nstriking feature consists of the passage (active and passive) of proglottids.\nOccasionally, appendicitis or cholangitis can result from migrating\nproglottids. _Taenia solium_ taeniasis is less frequently symptomatic than\n_Taenia saginata_ taeniasis. The main symptom is often the passage (passive)\nof proglottids. The most important feature of _Taenia solium_ taeniasis is the\nrisk of development of cysticercosis.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Taenia_ spp. eggs.\n\nThe eggs of _Taenia_ spp. are indistinguishable from each other, as well as\nfrom other members of the Taeniidae. The eggs measure 30-35 micrometers in\ndiameter and are radially-striated. The internal oncosphere contains six\nrefractile hooks.\n\n![](/dpdx/taeniasis/images/1/Taenia_eggs_wtmt_400x.jpg?_=96652)\n\nFigure A: _Taenia_ sp. eggs in unstained wet mounts.\n\n![](/dpdx/taeniasis/images/1/Taenia_egg1.jpg?_=96653)\n\nFigure E: Unstained _Taenia_ sp. egg, teased from a proglottid of an adult.\nFour hooks can easily be seen in this image.\n\n![](/dpdx/taeniasis/images/1/Taenia_egg.jpg?_=96649)\n\nFigure B: _Taenia_ sp. egg in unstained wet mounts.\n\n![](/dpdx/taeniasis/images/1/Taenia_egg_wtmt_KS.jpg?_=96650)\n\nFigure C: Iodine-stained wet mount of a _Taenia_ sp. egg.

There are usually 13 hooks of\neach size. The scolex of _T. saginata_ has four large suckers but lacks the\nrostellum and rostellar hooks. The scolex of _T. asiatica_ possesses\nrudimentary hooklets in a wart-like formation.\n\n![](/dpdx/taeniasis/images/2/Taenia_solium_scolex1.jpg?_=96647)\n\nFigure A: Scolex of _T. solium_.

Proglottids of _T. asiatica_ are similar to _T. saginata_ and\npossess more than 12 primary uterine branches.\n\n![](/dpdx/taeniasis/images/3/Taenia_saginata_carmine.jpg?_=96640)\n\nFigure A: Mature proglottid of _T. saginata_ , stained with carmine.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n#### Microscopy\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs and proglottids in feces is diagnostic for\ntaeniasis, but is not possible during the first 3 months following infection,\nprior to development of adult tapeworms. Repeated examination and\nconcentration techniques will increase the likelihood of detecting light\ninfections. Nevertheless, identification of _Taenia_ is not possible if solely\nbased on microscopic examination of eggs, because all _Taenia_ species produce\neggs that are morphologically identical. Eggs of _Taenia_ spp. are also\nindistinguishable from those produced by cestodes of the genus _Echinococcus_\n(tapeworms of dogs and other canid hosts). Microscopic identification of\ngravid proglottids (or, more rarely, examination of the scolex) allows species\ndetermination.\n\nTAKE EXTREME CARE IN PROCESSING THE SPECIMENS! INGESTION OF EGGS CAN RESULT IN\nCYSTICERCOSIS!\n\n![Mature proglottid of T. saginata, stained with India ink. Note the number of\nprimary uterine branches \\(>12\\). Image courtesy of the Orange County Public\nHealth Laboratory, Santa Ana,\nCA.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/taeniasis/T_saginata_OrangeCo.jpg)\n\n**Figure B:** Mature proglottid of _T. saginata_ , stained with India ink.\nNote the number of primary uterine branches (>12). Image courtesy of the\nOrange County Public Health Laboratory, Santa Ana, CA.\n\nSeparation of _T. saginata_ and _T. solium_ is best accomplished by\nexamination of mature proglottids. _Taenia saginata_ has 12-30 primary lateral\nuterine branches, while _T. solium_ has 7-13 primary lateral uterine branches.\nVisualization of the branches can be improved by clearing the specimen in\nlactophenol followed by India ink injection into the lateral genital pore. The\nprocedure is as follows:\n\n  1. Clear the formalin-fixed proglottids in lactophenol (50/50 liquefied phenol crystals in lactic acid) for at least 30 minutes (thicker specimen may take a few hours to overnight).\n  2. Gently sandwich the proglottids between two glass microscope slides, with the genital pore exposed along the edge of the two slides.\n  3. Using a small gauge (25 or 27 g) tuberculin syringe, slowly inject India ink into the genital pore.\n  4. Allow the ink to flow down the uterine stem and into the primary uterine branches.\n  5. Count the number of **primary** uterine branches to determine the species (7-13 for _T. solium_ and 12-30 for _T. saginata_).\n\n#### Antibody detection\n\nMay prove useful especially in the early invasive stages, when the eggs and\nproglottids are not yet apparent in the stools.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n",
