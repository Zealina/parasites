  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nThe nematode (roundworm) _Capillaria (=Paracapillaria) philippinensis_ causes\nhuman intestinal capillariasis. Unlike _C. hepatica,_ humans are most likely\nthe main definitive host. Transmission occurs primarily through eating\nundercooked fish.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/intestinalcapillariasis/modules/C_phil_LifeCycle_20.jpg?_=09345)](/dpdx/intestinalcapillariasis/modules/C_phil_LifeCycle_lg_20.jpg)\n\n[View\nLarger](/dpdx/intestinalcapillariasis/modules/C_phil_LifeCycle_lg_20.jpg)\n\nTypically, unembryonated, thick-shelled eggs are passed in the human stool\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) and become embryonated in\nthe external environment in 5—10 days\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) ; after ingestion by\nfreshwater fish, larvae hatch, penetrate the intestine, and migrate to the\ntissues ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . Ingestion of raw\nor undercooked fish results in infection of the human host.\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) The adults of _Capillaria\nphilippinensis_ are very small (males: 2.3 to 3.2mm; females: 2.5 to 4.3 mm)\nand reside in the human small intestine, where they burrow in the mucosa\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . In addition to the\nunembryonated, shelled eggs which pass into the environment, the females can\nalso produce eggs lacking shells (possessing only a vitelline membrane)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) , which become embryonated\nwithin the female’s uterus or in the intestine. The released larvae can re-\ninvade the intestinal mucosa and cause internal autoinfection\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . This process may lead to\nhyperinfection (a massive number of adult worms).\n\n### Hosts\n\nWhile piscivorous birds have been suggested as a wildlife reservoir of\n_C.__philippinensis,_ this has not been well substantiated based on field\nobservations. Experimental trials have established heavy patent infections in\nseveral bird species (particularly herons, egrets, and bitterns), but\nextensive surveys of wild birds in endemic areas have largely failed to detect\ninfection. Many species of freshwater fish appear susceptible to infection and\nact as intermediate hosts.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nAs the name suggests,_Capillaria philippinensis_ is endemic in the Philippines\nand epidemics have occurred in the Northern Luzon region. The parasite is also\nendemic in Thailand, and sporadic cases have been reported from other East and\nSoutheast Asian countries. More recently, a number of cases have been\nidentified in northern Egypt.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nIntestinal capillariasis initially manifests as abdominal/gastrointestinal\ndisease, which can become serious if not treated because of autoinfection. A\nprotein-losing enteropathy can develop which may result in complications such\nas cardiomyopathy, severe emaciation, cachexia, and death. In the first\nrecognized outbreak of intestinal capillariasis, the case fatality rate was\nover 10%.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "_**Capillaria philippinensis**_**eggs.**\n\n_Capillaria philippinensis_ eggs are 35 to 45 µm in length by 20-25 µm in\nwidth, somewhat smaller than _C. hepatica_. They have two flat polar\nprominences and a striated shell. Eggs are unembryonated when passed in feces.\n\n![Figure\nA](/dpdx/intestinalcapillariasis/images/1/C_philippinensis_egg1.jpg?_=01425)\n\nFigure A: Egg of _C. philippinensis_ in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n![Figure\nB](/dpdx/intestinalcapillariasis/images/1/C_philippinensis_egg2.jpg?_=01428)\n\nFigure B: Egg of _C. philippinensis_ in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n![Figure\nC](/dpdx/intestinalcapillariasis/images/1/C_philippinensis_egg4.jpg?_=01426)\n\nFigure C: Egg of _C. philippinensis_ in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n_**Capillaria philippinensis**_**adults.**\n\n_Capillaria philippinensis_ adult males are 2.0—3.5 mm in length and females\nare 2.5—4.5 mm in length.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\nThe specific diagnosis of _C. philippinensis_ is established by finding eggs,\nlarvae and/or adult worms in the stool or in intestinal biopsies.\nUnembryonated eggs are the typical stage found in the feces. In severe\ninfections, embryonated eggs, larvae, and even adult worms can be found in the\nfeces. No valid serologic testing is available for diagnosis.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard\nprecautions](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html)\napply when processing stool samples. Eggs of _C. philippinensis_ are not\ninfectious to humans.\n\n",
