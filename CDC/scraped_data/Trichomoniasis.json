  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\n_Trichomonas vaginalis_ , a flagellate, is the most common pathogenic\nprotozoan of humans in industrialized countries.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/trichomoniasis/modules/Trichomonas_LifeCycle.gif?_=04928)\n\n_Trichomonas vaginalis_ resides in the female lower genital tract and the male\nurethra and prostate ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif), where it\nreplicates by binary fission ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif). The\nparasite does not appear to have a cyst form, and does not survive well in the\nexternal environment. _Trichomonas vaginalis_ is transmitted among humans, its\nonly known host, primarily by sexual intercourse ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide. Higher prevalence among persons with multiple sexual partners or\nother venereal diseases.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n_Trichomonas vaginalis_ infection in women is frequently symptomatic.\nVaginitis with a purulent discharge is the prominent symptom, and can be\naccompanied by vulvar and cervical lesions, abdominal pain, dysuria and\ndyspareunia. The incubation period is 5 to 28 days. In men, the infection is\nfrequently asymptomatic; occasionally, urethritis, epididymitis, and\nprostatitis can occur.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Trichomonas vaginalis_ trophozoites.\n\nTrophozoites of _Trichomonas vaginalis_ are pyriform and 7-30 Âµm long. They\nhave five flagella: four anteriorly directed flagella and one posteriorly\nalong the outer membrane of the undulating membrane. The large nucleus is\nusually located at the wider, anterior end and contains many chromatin\ngranules and a small karyosome. The cytoplasm also contains many granules, but\nthese are often not seen in Giemsa-stained specimens.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichomoniasis/images/Trichomonas_trophA.jpg?_=04913)\n\nFigure A: Two trophozoites of _T. vaginalis_ obtained from in vitro culture,\nstained with Giemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichomoniasis/images/T_vaginalis_troph_BAM1.jpg?_=04916)\n\nFigure B: Trophozoite of _T. vaginalis_ in a vaginal smear, stained with\nGiemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichomoniasis/images/T_vaginalis_troph_BAM2.jpg?_=04915)\n\nFigure C: Trophozoite of _T. vaginalis_ in a vaginal smear, stained with\nGiemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichomoniasis/images/T_vaginalis_troph_BAM5.jpg?_=04918)\n\nFigure D: Trophozoite of _T. vaginalis_ in a vaginal smear, stained with\nGiemsa.\n\n",
  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic examination of wet mounts may establish the diagnosis by detecting\nactively motile organisms. This is the most practical and rapid method of\ndiagnosis (allowing immediate treatment), but it is relatively insensitive.\nDirect immunofluorescent antibody staining is more sensitive than wet mounts,\nbut technically more complex. Culture of the parasite is the most sensitive\nmethod, but results are not available for 3 to 7 days. In women, examination\nshould be performed on vaginal and urethral secretions. In men, anterior\nurethral or prostatic secretions should be examined.\n\n",
