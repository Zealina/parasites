  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nThe nematode (roundworm)_Angiostrongylus (=Parastrongylus) cantonensis_ , also\ncalled the rat lungworm, is a common cause of human eosinophilic meningitis\n(neural angiostrongyliasis) and occasionally ocular disease.\n\n_Angiostrongylus costaricensis_ is the causal agent of abdominal\nangiostrongyliasis and is discussed [here](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_cos/).\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle\nimage](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_can/modules/Angio_cant_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=58452)](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_can/modules/Angio_cant_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View\nLarger](/dpdx/angiostrongyliasis_can/modules/Angio_cant_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nAdult worms of _A. cantonensis_ live in the pulmonary arteries and right\nventricle of the normal definitive host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . The females lay eggs\nthat hatch in the terminal branches of the pulmonary arteries, yielding first-\nstage larvae. The first-stage larvae migrate to the pharynx, are swallowed,\nand passed in the feces. They penetrate or are ingested by a gastropod\nintermediate host ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . After\ntwo molts, third-stage larvae are produced\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) which are infective to\nmammalian hosts. When the infected gastropod is ingested by the definitive\nhost, the third-stage larvae migrate to the brain where they develop into\nyoung adults ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The young\nadults return to the venous system and then the pulmonary arteries where they\nbecome sexually mature. Of note, various animals act as paratenic (transport)\nhosts: after ingesting the infected snails, they carry the third-stage larvae\nwhich can resume their development when the paratenic host is ingested by a\ndefinitive host. Humans can acquire the infection by eating raw or undercooked\nsnails or slugs infected with the parasite; they may also acquire the\ninfection by eating raw produce that contains a small snail or slug, or part\nof one ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . There is some\nquestion whether or not larvae can exit the infected gastropods in slime\n(which may be infective to humans if ingested, for example, on produce).\nInfection may also be acquired by ingestion of invertebrate paratenic hosts\ncontaining L3 larvae (e.g. crabs, freshwater shrimp). In humans, larvae\nmigrate to the brain, or rarely to the lungs, where the worms ultimately die\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . Larvae may develop to\nfourth or fifth stage in the human host, but seem to be incapable of maturing\nfully.\n\nLearn more about _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ in this [new motion graphic\nvideo](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/angiostrongylus/add_resources.html).\n\n### Hosts\n\n_A. cantonensis_ is known to use multiple rat species as definitive hosts,\nincluding black rats (_Rattus rattus_), brown rats, (_Rattus norvegicus_), and\ncotton rats (_Sigmodon hispidus_). Gastropod (snail and slug) intermediate\nhosts are numerous and include _Achatina_ spp., _Biomphlalaria_ spp.,\n_Bulinus_ spp., _Lymnaea_ spp., _Pomaecea_ spp., and more. Apart from humans,\naberrant infections have occurred in several species of wild and domestic\nmammals and birds.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nMost cases of _A. cantonensis-_ associated eosinophilic meningitis originate\nfrom Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands. The parasite has also been reported\nfrom Africa, the Caribbean, Australia, Hawaii, and recently the southern\nUnited States.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe most notable manifestation of _A. cantonensis_ infection is eosinophilic\nmeningitis caused by the presence of larvae in the brain and resultant local\nhost reactions. Somatic symptoms (e.g. headache, fever, malaise) as well as\nvarying degrees of neurological dysfunction are usually noted. _A._\n_cantonensis_ infection may occasionally prove fatal. Ocular\nangiostrongyliasis is associated with uveitis, blurred vision, and a\nsubstantial loss of visual acuity.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "#### Clinical and Morphologic Diagnosis\n\nIn eosinophilic meningitis with _A. cantonensis,_ the cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) is abnormal (elevated pressure, proteins, and leukocytes; eosinophilia).\nOn rare occasions, larvae have been found in the CSF or in sections of brain\ntissue.\n\n#### Molecular Diagnosis\n\nThe CDC offers a real-time PCR assay for the specific detection of _A.\ncantonensis_ in human CSF specimens. The CSF should be kept cold (ice packs)\nand shipped to CDC as soon as possible; alternatively it can be kept frozen\nuntil shipment is arranged. Shipment on dry ice is optional. Recommended\nvolume of CSF is at least 2 mL. Volumes less than 1 mL may lead to reduced\ntest sensitivity.\n\n#### Diagnostic References:\n\nQvarnstrom Y, da Silva AQA, Teem JL, Hollingsworth R, Bishop H, Graeff-\nTeixeira C, and da Silva AJ: Improved Molecular Detection of _Angiostrongylus\ncantonensis_ in Mollusks and Other Environmental Samples with a Species-\nSpecific Internal Transcribed Spacer 1-Based TaqMan Assay.
