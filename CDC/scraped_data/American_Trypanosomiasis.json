  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\n_Trypanosoma cruzi,_ is a parasitic protozoan that is the causative agent of\nChagas disease (American trypanosomiasis). Currently, six distinct lineages of\n_T. cruzi_ are classified into discrete typing units (TcI-VI), which vary in\ntheir geographic occurrence, host specificity, and pathogenicity.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Lifecycle](/dpdx/trypanosomiasisamerican/modules/Chagas_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=28581)](/dpdx/trypanosomiasisamerican/modules/Chagas_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/trypanosomiasisamerican/modules/Chagas_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nAn infected triatomine insect vector (or “kissing” bug) takes a blood meal and\nreleases trypomastigotes in its feces near the site of the bite wound.\nTrypomastigotes enter the host through the bite wound or intact mucosal\nmembranes, such as the conjunctiva\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Inside the host, the\ntrypomastigotes invade cells near the site of inoculation, where they\ndifferentiate into intracellular amastigotes\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . The amastigotes multiply\nby binary fission ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) and\ndifferentiate into trypomastigotes, and then are released into the circulation\nas bloodstream trypomastigotes\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . Trypomastigotes infect\ncells from a variety of tissues and transform into intracellular amastigotes\nin new infection sites. Clinical manifestations can result from this infective\ncycle. The bloodstream trypomastigotes do not replicate (different from the\nAfrican trypanosomes). Replication resumes only when the parasites enter\nanother cell or are ingested by another vector. The “kissing” bug becomes\ninfected by feeding on human or animal blood that contains circulating\nparasites ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . The ingested\ntrypomastigotes transform into epimastigotes in the vector’s midgut\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . The parasites multiply\nand differentiate in the midgut\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) and differentiate into\ninfective metacyclic trypomastigotes in the hindgut\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) . Other less common routes\nof transmission include blood transfusions, organ transplantation,\ntransplacental transmission, and foodborne transmission (via food/drink\ncontaminated with the vector and/or its feces).  \n\n### Hosts/Vectors\n\nApart from humans, a number of mammals serve as reservoir hosts for _T.\ncruzi,_ e.g. armadillos, opossums, raccoons, woodrats, some other rodents, and\ndomestic dogs. Common triatomine vector species for trypanosomiasis belong to\nthe genera _Triatoma_ , _Rhodnius_ , and _Panstrongylus_.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_T. cruzi_ is endemic in vectors and wildlife reservoirs throughout the\nAmericas from the southern half of the United States down to Argentina. Chagas\ndisease cases have been reported from South and Central American countries,\nparticularly in rural, impoverished areas. There have been a small number of\nautochthonous cases of Chagas disease in the United States.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nChagas disease has an acute phase and chronic phase. The acute phase is\nusually asymptomatic, but can present with nonspecific somatic symptoms.\nRarely, the acute phase may be more severe with potential cardiac or\nneurologic symptoms and signs. Nodular lesions or furuncles, usually called\nchagomas, may develop around the vector’s feeding site. Chagomas occurring on\nthe on the eyelids are commonly referred to as palpebral and periocular firm\nswelling. Most acute cases resolve over a period of a few weeks or months into\na subclinical chronic form of the disease (“indeterminate form”). Reactivation\nof Chagas disease from this asymptomatic form may occur in patients with HIV\nor those receiving immunosuppressive drugs.\n\nThe symptomatic chronic form (“determinate form”) may not occur for years or\neven decades after initial infection. This may include cardiac or\ngastrointestinal involvement, which occasionally occur together. The many\ncomplications of chronic Chagas disease can be fatal. Amastigote invasion of\nsmooth muscle can lead to megaesophagus, megacolon, and dilated\ncardiomyopathy.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Morphology\n\nIn the acute stage of the disease, diagnosis may be made by the finding of\ntrypomastigotes in circulating blood or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). During\nthe chronic stage, trypomastigotes are usually not found circulating in blood\nand serologic testing is recommended (see below). Amastigotes may be found in\nbiopsy specimens stained with hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) or Giemsa.\n\n#### Serology (Antibody Detection)\n\n![Positive IFA result with T. cruzi antigen \\(magnification\n400x\\).](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/trypanosomiasisAmerican/Tcruzi_IFA_positive.jpg)\n\nPositive IFA result with _T. cruzi_ antigen (magnification 400x).\n\nDuring the acute phase of illness, blood film examination generally reveals\nthe presence of trypomastigotes. However, during the chronic phase of\ninfection, parasitemia is low and immunodiagnosis is a useful technique for\ndetermining whether the patient is infected.\n\nDiagnosis of chronic Chagas disease in suspected patients is based on serology\nperformed with at least two different serologic tests. CDC utilizes an FDA-\ncleared enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on recombinant T. cruzi antigens\nalongside an immunoblot (TESA) as the two first-line tests. If initial EIA and\nTESA results are discordant, a second specimen is requested and testing is\nrepeated. If results of the second EIA and TESA are discordant, an\nimmunofluorescence assay (IFA) is used as a “tie-breaker” test. Various\nserologic methods are commercially available in other countries for laboratory\ndiagnosis of Chagas disease. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests\nare highly variable.\n\n#### Molecular Testing\n\nMolecular diagnosis of Chagas disease is performed for cases of suspected\nacute infection (including transfusion or transplant transmission), congenital\nChagas disease, and for monitoring of suspected laboratory exposures. For\nchronic Chagas disease, serology is generally most appropriate, although\nmolecular detection may be performed for re-activated cases associated with\nimmunosuppression.\n\nAt CDC molecular detection of T. cruzi DNA is performed using a combination of\ntwo real-time PCR assays (TCZ and MNC). Acceptable specimen types are EDTA\nblood (minimum of 2.2 ml), heart biopsy tissue (in saline or paraffin-\nembedded) and, in cases of suspected central nervous system involvement, CSF.\n\n### References:\n\nBern C, Montgomery SP, Herwaldt B L, Marin-Neto JA, Dantas RO, Maguire JH,\nAcquatella H, Morillo C, Kirchhoff LV, Gilman RH, Reyes, PA, Salvatella R,\nMoore AC.
