  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\n_Pthirus pubis_ , the pubic or crab louse, is an insect of the order Psocodea\nand is an ectoparasite whose only host are humans.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/pthiriasis/modules/Pthiriasis_LifeCycle.gif?_=00956)\n\nPubic lice (_Pthirus pubis_) have three stages: egg, nymph and adult. Eggs\n(nits) are laid on a hair shaft ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif). Females\nwill lay approximately 30 eggs during their 3-4 week life span. Eggs hatch\nafter about a week and become nymphs, which look like smaller versions of the\nadults. The nymphs undergo three molts (![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif), ![The\nnumber 3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif),\n![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif)) before\nbecoming adults ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif). Adults\nare 1.5-2.0 mm long and flattened. They are much broader in comparison to head\nand body lice. Adults are found only on the human host and require human blood\nto survive. If adults are forced off the host, they will die within 24-48\nhours without a blood feeding. Pubic lice are transmitted from person to\nperson most-commonly via sexual contact, although fomites (bedding, clothing)\nmay play a minor role in their transmission.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nPthiriais is common and is distributed worldwide.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe majority of infestations are asymptomatic. When symptoms are noted they\nmay include a tickling feeling of something moving in the hair, itching,\ncaused by the an allergic reaction to louse saliva, and irritability. Pruritis\ncaused by the bites of pubic lice may be very intense, and discoloration of\nthe skin may occur if the infestation is left untreated for an extended length\nof time.\n\n##### Modes of Transmission:\n\nThe main mode of transmission is person to person by sexual contact with\nsomeone who is already infested. Fomites (bedding, clothing) may play a minor\nrole, although rare.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Pthirus pubis_ , adults and nymphs.\n\nAdult pubic lice (_Pthirus pubis_) measure 1.5-2.0 mm long and are\ndorsoventrally-flattened. Adults are much broader in comparison to head and\nbody lice. The second and third legs have a large modified claw with a thumb-\nlike projection, used for grasping on to hair shafts. Nymphs resemble the\nadults but are smaller; there are three nymphal stages in the life cycle of\n_P. pubis_. Adults and nymphs require human blood and are found only on the\nhuman host; although they are most-commonly found in the pubic and perianal\nregions, they may also be found on armpit, mustache, and chest hairs.\n\n![](/dpdx/pthiriasis/images/1/Phthirus_pubis_female.jpg?_=00952)\n\nFigure A: Adult female _P. pubis_.

Eggs are glued to a hair shaft. Eggs take about\none week to hatch.\n\n![](/dpdx/pthiriasis/images/2/Phthirus_pubis_egg.jpg?_=00945)\n\nFigure A: Egg (nit) of _P. pubis_.\n\n",
  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\nThe diagnosis of pthiriasis is best made by finding a live nymph, adult louse,\nor a nit on the hair of a person, usually in the pubic or perianal area,\nalthough they may also be found on armpit, moustache and chest hairs.\n\n",
