  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nSchistosomiasis (Bilharziasis) is caused by some species of blood trematodes\n(flukes) in the genus _Schistosoma_. The three main species infecting humans\nare S _chistosoma haematobium_ , _S. japonicum_ , and _S. mansoni_. Three\nother species, more localized geographically, are _S. mekongi_ , _S.\nintercalatum,_ and _S. guineensis_(previously considered synonymous with _S.\nintercalatum_). There have also been a few reports of hybrid schistosomes of\ncattle origin (_S. haematobium_ , x _S. bovis_ , x _S. curassoni,_ x _S.\nmattheei_) infecting humans. Unlike other trematodes, which are\nhermaphroditic, _Schistosoma_ spp. are dioecous (individuals of separate\nsexes).\n\nIn addition, other species of schistosomes, which parasitize birds and\nmammals, can cause [cercarial\ndermatitis](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/cercarialdermatitis/index.html) in humans\nbut this is clinically distinct from schistosomiasis.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/schistosomiasis/modules/Schistomes_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=18152)](/dpdx/schistosomiasis/modules/Schistomes_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/schistosomiasis/modules/Schistomes_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n_Schistosoma_ eggs are eliminated with feces or urine, depending on species\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Under appropriate\nconditions the eggs hatch and release miracidia\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) , which swim and penetrate\nspecific snail intermediate hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The stages in the snail\ninclude two generations of sporocysts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) and the production of\ncercariae ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Upon release\nfrom the snail, the infective cercariae swim, penetrate the skin of the human\nhost ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) , and shed their\nforked tails, becoming schistosomulae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . The schistosomulae\nmigrate via venous circulation to lungs, then to the heart, and then develop\nin the liver, exiting the liver via the portal vein system when mature,\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) . Male and female adult\nworms copulate and reside in the mesenteric venules, the location of which\nvaries by species (with some exceptions)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/10.jpg) . For instance, _S.\njaponicum_ is more frequently found in the superior mesenteric veins draining\nthe small intestine\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_sq_a.gif) , and _S.\nmansoni_ occurs more often in the inferior mesenteric veins draining the large\nintestine ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_sq_b.gif) .\nHowever, both species can occupy either location and are capable of moving\nbetween sites. _S. intercalatum_ and _S. guineensis_ also inhabit the inferior\nmesenteric plexus but lower in the bowel than _S. mansoni_. _S. haematobium_\nmost often inhabitsin the vesicular and pelvic venous plexus of the bladder\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/bladder_sq_c.gif) , but it can also\nbe found in the rectal venules. The females (size ranges from 7–28 mm,\ndepending on species) deposit eggs in the small venules of the portal and\nperivesical systems. The eggs are moved progressively toward the lumen of the\nintestine (_S. mansoni_ ,_S. japonicum, S. mekongi, S.\nintercalatum/guineensis_) and of the bladder and ureters (_S. haematobium_),\nand are eliminated with feces or urine, respectively\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\nVarious animals such as cattle, dogs, cats, rodents, pigs, horses, and goats,\nserve as reservoirs for _S. japonicum_ , and dogs for _S. mekongi_. _S.\nmansoni_ is also frequently recovered from wild primates in endemic areas but\nis considered primarily a human parasite and not a zoonosis.\n\nIntermediate hosts are snails of the genera _Biomphalaria,_(_S. mansoni_)_,\nOncomelania (S. japonicum_)_, Bulinus_ (_S. haematobium, S. intercalatum, S.\nguineensis_)_._ The only known intermediate host for _S. mekongi_ is\n_Neotricula aperta_.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Schistosoma mansoni_ is found primarily across sub-Saharan Africa and some\nSouth American countries (Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname) and the Caribbean, with\nsporadic reports in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n_S. haematobium_ is found in Africa and pockets of the Middle East.\n\n_S. japonicum_ is found in China, the Philippines, and Sulawesi. Despite its\nname, it has long been eliminated from Japan.\n\nThe other, less common human-infecting species have relatively restricted\ngeographic ranges. _S. mekongi_ occurs focally in parts of Cambodia and Laos.\n_S. intercalatum_ has only been found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n_S. guineensis_ is found in West Africa. Instances of infections with\nhybrid/introgressed _Schistosoma_(_S. haematobium_ x _S. bovis,_ x _S.\ncurassoni,_ x _S. mattheei_) have occurred in Corsica, France, and some West\nAfrican countries.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nSymptoms of schistosomiasis are not caused by the worms themselves but by the\nbody’s reaction to the eggs. Many infections are asymptomatic. A local\ncutaneous hypersensitivity reaction following skin penetration by cercariae\nmay occur and appears as small, itchy maculopapular lesions. Acute\nschistosomiasis (Katayama fever) is a systemic hypersensitivity reaction that\nmay occur weeks after the initial infection, especially by _S. mansoni_ and\n_S. japonicum_. Manifestations include systemic symptoms/signs including\nfever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and eosinophilia.\n\nOccasionally, _Schistosoma_ infections may lead to central nervous system\nlesions. Cerebral granulomatous disease may be caused by ectopic _S.\njaponicum_ eggs in the brain, and granulomatous lesions around ectopic eggs in\nthe spinal cord may occur in _S. mansoni_ and _S. haematobium_ infections.\nContinuing infection may cause granulomatous reactions and fibrosis in the\naffected organs (e.g., liver and spleen) with associated signs/symptoms.\n\nPathology associated with _S. mansoni_ and _S. japonicum_ schistosomiasis\nincludes various hepatic complications from inflammation and granulomatous\nreactions, and occasional embolic egg granulomas in brain or spinal cord.\nPathology of _S. haematobium_ schistosomiasis includes hematuria, scarring,\ncalcification, squamous cell carcinoma, and occasional embolic egg granulomas\nin brain or spinal cord.\n\n",

Eggs are shed from the human host in feces or urine. Under optimal\nconditions in the environment, the eggs hatch and release miracidia, which\nswim and penetrate specific snail intermediate hosts. The stages in the snail\ninclude two generations of sporocysts and the production of cercariae. Upon\nrelease from the snail, the infective cercariae swim and penetrate the skin of\nthe human host, where maturation of the worms continues. _Oncomelania_ spp.\nare the intermediate hosts for _S. japonicum_ , while _Neotricula_ spp. are\nthe intermediate hosts for _S. mekongi_. _Biomphalaria_ spp. are the\nintermediate hosts for _S. mansoni_ , both in the New and Old Worlds.\n_Bulinus_ spp. are the intermediate hosts for _S. haematobium_ and _S.\nintercalatum_.\n\n![](/dpdx/schistosomiasis/images/9/Biomphalaria1.jpg?_=96137)\n\nFigure A: _Biomphalaria_ sp., the intermediate host for _S. mansoni._.\n\n![](/dpdx/schistosomiasis/images/9/Bulinus1.jpg?_=96140)\n\nFigure B: _Bulinus_ sp., the intermediate host for _S. haematobium_ and _S.\nintercalatum_.\n\n![](/dpdx/schistosomiasis/images/9/Oncomelania1.jpg?_=96138)\n\nFigure C: _Oncomelania_ sp., the intermediate host for _S. japonicum_.\n\n",
  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs in stool or urine is the usual method for\ndiagnosis. Stool examination should be performed when infection with _S.\nmansoni_ or _S. japonicum_ is suspected, and urine examination should be\nperformed if _S. haematobium_ is suspected. Eggs can be present in the stool\nin infections with all _Schistosoma_ species. The examination can be performed\non a simple smear (1 to 2 mg of fecal material). Since eggs may be passed\nintermittently or in small amounts, their detection will be enhanced by\nrepeated examinations and/or concentration procedures (such as the formalin-\nethyl acetate technique). In addition, for field surveys and investigational\npurposes, the egg output can be quantified by using the Kato-Katz technique\n(20 to 50 mg of fecal material; the standard Kato-Katz template is calibrated\nto 41.7 mg) or formalin ethyl acetate concentration. Further, homogenization\nof the whole fecal sample may enhance recovery of eggs for _S. japonicum,_ as\neggs may have an uneven distribution within feces. Eggs can be found in the\nurine in infections with _S. haematobium_ (recommended time for collection:\nbetween noon and 3 PM) and with _S. japonicum_. Detection will be enhanced by\ncentrifugation and examination of the sediment. Quantification is possible by\nusing filtration through a polycarbonate membrane of a standard volume of\nurine followed by egg counts on the membrane. Tissue biopsy (rectal biopsy for\nall species and biopsy of the bladder for _S. haematobium_) may demonstrate\neggs when stool or urine examinations are negative.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n### Antibody detection\n\nAntibody detection can be useful to indicate schistosome infection in patients\nwho have traveled in schistosomiasis endemic areas and in whom eggs cannot be\ndemonstrated in fecal or urine specimens. Test sensitivity and specificity\nvary widely among the many tests reported for the serologic diagnosis of\nschistosomiasis and are dependent on both the type of antigen preparations\nused (crude, purified, adult worm, egg, cercarial) and the test procedure.\n\nAt CDC, a combination of tests with purified adult worm antigens is used for\nantibody detection. Serum specimens are first tested by FAST-ELISA using\n_Schistosoma mansoni_ adult microsomal antigen (MAMA). A positive reaction\nindicates infection with _Schistosoma_ species. Because test sensitivity with\nthe FAST-ELISA is reduced for species other than _S. mansoni_ , immunoblots of\nthe species appropriate to the patient’s travel history are also tested to\nimprove detection of _S. haematobium_ and _S. japonicum_ infections (MAMA –\n_S. mansoni_ , HAMA – _S. haematobium,_ JAMA – _S. japonicum_). However,\ncross-reaction with _S. mekongi, S. intercalatum,_ and _S. guineensis_\nspecimens has not yet been assessed. The presence of antibody is indicative\nonly of schistosome infection at some time and cannot be correlated with\nclinical status, worm burden, egg production, or prognosis. When submitting\nspecimens, please include the patient’s travel history so the appropriate\n_Schistosoma_ species will be tested by immunoblot.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard protocols apply for the processing of\n[stool](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html), urine, and/or\n[serum](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/serum/safety.html) samples. _Schistosoma_\nspp. eggs are not infectious to humans, however, precautions should still be\ntaken to avoid exposure to other pathogens that may be present in stools.\n\n",
