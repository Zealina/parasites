Genera\n_Cerithidia_ and _Pironella_ are important snail hosts in Asia and the Middle\nEast respectively. The miracidia undergo several developmental stages in the\nsnail, i.e. sporocysts![The number\n2a](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2a.gif),\nrediae![The number\n2b](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2b.gif), and\ncercariae![The number\n2c](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2c.gif). Many\ncercariae are produced from each redia. The cercariae are released from the\nsnail![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif) and\nencyst as metacercariae in the tissues of a suitable fresh/brackish water fish\n(second intermediate host)![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif). The\ndefinitive host becomes infected by ingesting undercooked or salted fish\ncontaining metacercariae![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_5.gif). After\ningestion, the metacercariae excyst, attach to the mucosa of the small\nintestine![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_6.gif)\nand mature into adults (measuring 1.0 to 1.7 mm by 0.3 to 0.4 mm)![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_7.gif).\nIn addition to humans, various fish-eating mammals (e.g., cats and dogs) and\nbirds can be infected by _Heterophyes heterophyes_ ![The number\n8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_8.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nEgypt, the Middle East, and Far East.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe main symptoms are diarrhea and colicky abdominal pain. Migration of the\neggs to the heart, resulting in potentially fatal myocardial and valvular\ndamage, has been reported from the Philippines. Migration to other organs\n(e.g., brain) has also been reported.\n\n[ ](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/heterophyiasis/index.html#)\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### Adult of _Heterophyes heterophyes_.\n\nAdults of _Heterophyes heterophyes_ are minute flukes, measuring 1-2 mm in\nlength. The tests are large and paired, and are situated near a small ovary.\nThe surface of the worm is covered with minute spines. Adults reside in the\nsmall intestine of the definitive host.\n\n![](/dpdx/heterophyiasis/images/1/H_heterophyes_adult_BAM3.jpg?_=01547)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _H. heterophyes_ , stained with carmine. In this figure,\nthe following structures are labeled: oral sucker (OS), pharynx (PH),\nintestine (IN), ventral sucker, or acetabulum (AC), and eggs within the uterus\n(UT)\n\n##### Snail intermediate hosts of _Heterophyes heterophyes_.\n\nLike all trematodes, _Heterophyes heterophyes_ requires a snail as an\nintermediate host. _Cerithideopsilla cingulata_ is the main first intermediate\nhost for _H. heterophyes_ in southeast Asia.\n\n![](/dpdx/heterophyiasis/images/2/Cerithideopsilla_Conchology_A.jpg?_=01549)\n\nFigure A: _Cerithideopsilla cingulata_ , an intermediate host for _H.\nheterophyes_ in southeast Asia.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis is based on the microscopic identification of eggs in the stool.\nHowever, the eggs are indistinguishable from those of _Metagonimus yokogawai_\nand resemble those of _Clonorchis_ and _Opisthorchis_.\n\n",
