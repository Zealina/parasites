  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nDespite its name, _Dientamoeba fragilis_ is not an ameba but an intestinal\nflagellate, most closely related to trichomonads. In human stool specimens,\n_D. fragilis_ is almost always found solely as a trophozoite. However, the\nrare presence of putative cyst and precyst forms in clinical specimens has\nbeen reported; their transmission potential is being investigated. Other\naspects of the transmission and pathogenicity of _D. fragilis_ also are poorly\nunderstood.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Life\nCycle](/dpdx/dientamoeba/modules/Dfragilis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=89587)](/dpdx/dientamoeba/modules/Dfragilis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/dientamoeba/modules/Dfragilis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nThe complete life cycle of _Dientamoeba fragilis_ has not yet been elucidated;\nassumptions have been made on the basis of clinical observations and the\nbiology of related species (in particular, _Histomonas meleagridis,_ a\nparasite of galliform birds). Trophozoites are found in the lumen of the large\nintestine, where they multiply via binary fission, and are shed in the stool\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Historically, only the\ntrophozoite stage of _D. fragilis_ had been detected. However, rare putative\ncyst and precyst forms have been described in human clinical specimens;\nwhether and in what settings transmission to humans occurs via ingestion of\nsuch forms in contrast or in addition to other fecal-oral transmission routes\nis not yet known ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) .\nTransmission via helminth eggs (e.g., via _Enterobius_ _vermicularis_ eggs)\nhas been postulated ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\n_Dientamoeba fragilis_ is primarily a parasite of humans. Trophozoites have\nbeen identified in some other mammals (e.g., non-human primates, swine), but\nthe epidemiologic significance of these hosts is unknown.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Dientamoeba fragilis_ is found worldwide. Infection appears to be more common\nin children.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe pathogenicity and clinical importance of _D. fragilis_ continue to be\ninvestigated, including whether particular genotypes, subtypes, or strains of\n_D. fragilis_ are associated with symptomatic infection in humans. Both\nasymptomatic and symptomatic infection (e.g., with various nonspecific\ngastrointestinal symptoms) have been reported. The reported clinical\nmanifestations have sometimes been described as similar to those of colitis,\nappendicitis, or irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### _Dientamoeba fragilis_ binucleate trophozoites stained with trichrome\n\n_Dientamoeba fragilis_ is a flagellate that lacks external flagella and\ntherefore must be morphologically differentiated from the small nonpathogenic\namebae (e.g., _Endolimax nana_ ,_Entamoeba hartmanni_). _Dientamoeba fragilis_\ntrophozoites measure 5 to 15 µm; cyst-like stages are rare. Pseudopodia are\nangular to broad-lobed and transparent. Although most trophozoites are\nbinucleate, some have only one nucleus. The nucleus typically has a fragmented\nkaryosome with discrete chromatin granules, and a thin nuclear membrane may be\nvisible.\n\n![parasitic image](/dpdx/dientamoeba/images/1/Df_labels_A-\nmedium_cropped.jpg?_=89625)\n\nFigure A: Binucleate form of a trophozoite of D. fragilis, stained with\ntrichrome.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nInfection typically is diagnosed by detection of _D. fragilis_ trophozoites in\nfecal smears stained with trichrome or another permanent stain. The\ntrophozoite stage of the parasite is not usually detectable if stool\nconcentration methods are used. _Dientamoeba fragilis_ trophozoites can easily\nbe overlooked or misidentified because they are pale-staining and their nuclei\nsometimes resemble those of _Endolimax nana_ or _Entamoeba hartmanni_.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\nLaboratory results, including prevalence rates, based on real-time PCR\nanalysis should be approached with caution because of the performance\nvariability across platforms and the potential for low specificity.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions for processing [stool\nspecimens](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) apply.\n\n",
