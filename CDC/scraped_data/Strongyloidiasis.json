  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe rhabditid nematode (roundworm) _Strongyloides stercoralis_ is the major\ncausative agent of strongyloidiasis in humans. Rarer human-infecting species\nof _Strongyloides_ are the zoonotic _S. fuelleborni_(_fülleborni_) subsp.\n_fuelleborni_ and _S. fuelleborni_ subsp._kellyi_ , for which the only\ncurrently known host is humans. _Strongyloides_ spp. are sometimes called\n“threadworms” (although in some countries this common name refers to\n_Enterobius vermicularis_).\n\nOther animal-associated _Strongyloides_ spp._,_ including _S.\nmyopotami_(nutria), _S._ _procyonis_(raccoons), and possibly others, may\nproduce mild short-lived cutaneous infections in human hosts (larva currens,\n“nutria itch”), but do not cause true strongyloidiasis.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n_**Strongyloides stercoralis** _\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/modules/Strongyloides_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=51499)](/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/modules/Strongyloides_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/modules/Strongyloides_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nThe _Strongyloides stercoralis_ life cycle is complex, alternating between\nfree-living and parasitic cycles and involving autoinfection. In the **free-\nliving cycle:** Rhabditiform larvae are passed in the stool of an infected\ndefinitive host ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) , develop\ninto either infective filariform larvae (direct development)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) or free-living adult males\nand females ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) that mate and\nproduce eggs ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) , from which\nrhabditiform larvae hatch ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg)\nand eventually become infective filariform (L3) slarvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . The filariform larvae\npenetrate the human host skin to initiate the parasitic cycle (see below)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . This second generation\nof filariform larvae cannot mature into free-living adults and must find a new\nhost to continue the life cycle.\n\n**Parasitic cycle:** Filariform larvae in contaminated soil penetrate human\nskin when skin contacts soil\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) , and migrate to the small\nintestine ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . It has been\nthought that the L3 larvae migrate via the bloodstream and lymphatics to the\nlungs, where they are eventually coughed up and swallowed. However, L3 larvae\nappear capable of migrating to the intestine via alternate routes (e.g.\nthrough abdominal viscera or connective tissue). In the small intestine, the\nlarvae molt twice and become adult female worms\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) . The females live\nembedded in the submucosa of the small intestine and produce eggs via\nparthenogenesis (parasitic males do not exist)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) , which yield rhabditiform\nlarvae. The rhabditiform larvae can either be passed in the stool\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) (see “Free-living cycle”\nabove), or can cause autoinfection\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/10.jpg) .\n\nRhabditiform larvae in the gut become infective filariform larvae that can\npenetrate either the intestinal mucosa or the skin of the perianal area,\nresulting in autoinfection. Once the filariform larvae reinfect the host, they\nare carried to the lungs, pharynx and small intestine as described above, or\ndisseminate throughout the body. The significance of autoinfection in\n_Strongyloides_ is that untreated cases can result in persistent infection,\neven after many decades of residence in a non-endemic area, and may contribute\nto the development of hyperinfection syndrome.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n**_Strongyloides fuelleborni_**\n\n[![](/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/modules/Strongyloides_fuelleborni_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=51495)](/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/modules/Strongyloides_fuelleborni_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View\nLarger](/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/modules/Strongyloides_fuelleborni_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n_Strongyloides fuelleborni_ follows the same life cycle as _S. stercoralis,_\nwith the important distinction that eggs (rather than larvae) are passed in\nthe stool ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Eggs hatch\nshortly after passage into the environment, releasing rhabditiform larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) , that develop to either\ninfective filariform larvae (direct development)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) or free-living adult males\nand females ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The free-\nliving adults mate and produce eggs, from which more rhabditiform larvae hatch\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) and eventually become\ninfective filariform larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . The filariform larvae\npenetrate the human host skin to initiate the parasitic cycle\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . These larvae migrate via\nthe bloodstream to the lungs, where they are eventually coughed up and\nswallowed, or reach the intestine via migration through connective tissue or\nabdominal viscera ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . In the\nsmall intestine, larvae molt twice and become adult female worms. Parasitic\nfemales embedded in the submucosa of the small intestine\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) and produce eggs via\nparthenogenesis (parasitic males do not exist)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) .\n\nSince eggs do not hatch within the host as with _S. stercoralis,_\nautoinfection is believed to be impossible. Transmission of _S. fuelleborni_\nsubsp. _kellyi_ to infants as a result of breastfeeding has been reported.\n\n### Hosts\n\n_Strongyloides_ spp. are generally host-specific, and _S. stercoralis_ is\nprimarily a human parasite. However, patent infections with parasitic females\nhave been detected in other primates (chimpanzees, monkeys, etc.) and domestic\ndogs. Two genetic populations have been found in domestic dogs, one that\nappears to only infect dogs and one that may infect both dogs and humans; all\nhuman infections have been attributed to this second genetic population.\nDomestic cats are experimentally susceptible to _S. stercoralis_ infections\nalthough it is unknown if they have a role as a natural reservoir.\n\n_Strongyloides fuelleborni_ subsp. _fuelleborni_ is a parasite of Old World\napes and monkeys. The only identified host of _S. fuelleborni_ subsp. _kellyi_\nis humans.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Strongyloides stercoralis_ is broadly distributed in tropical and subtropical\nareas across the globe. Transmission has been reported during summer months in\ntemperate areas. Infections are most common in areas with poor sanitation,\nrural and remote communities, institutional settings, and among socially\nmarginalized groups.\n\n_S. fuelleborni_ subsp. _fuelleborni_ occurs in non-human primates throughout\nthe Old World. The vast majority of human infections are reported from sub-\nSaharan Africa. Sporadic cases have been reported from Southeast Asia. _S.\nfuelleborni_ subsp. _kellyi_ is found in Papua New Guinea, and has not been\nreported elsewhere thus far.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe initial sign of acute strongyloidiasis, if noticed at all, is a localized\npruritic, erythematous rash at the site of skin penetration. Patients may then\ndevelop tracheal irritation and a dry cough as the larvae migrate from the\nlungs up through the trachea. After the larvae are swallowed into the\ngastrointestinal tract, patients may experience diarrhea, constipation,\nabdominal pain, and anorexia. Chronic strongyloidiasis is generally\nasymptomatic, but a variety of gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations\nmay occur. Rarely, patients with chronic strongyloidiasis may develop other\ncomplications (e.g. arthritis, cardiac arrhythmias, chronic malabsorption,\nduodenal obstruction, nephrotic syndrome, recurrent asthma). Up to 75% of\npeople with chronic strongyloidiasis have mild peripheral eosinophilia or\nelevated IgE levels.\n\nHyperinfection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis are most frequently\nassociated with subclinical infection in patients receiving high-dose\ncorticosteroids. Subsequent impaired host immunity leads to accelerated\nautoinfection and an overwhelming number of migrating larvae. In chronic\nstrongyloidiasis and in hyperinfection syndrome, the larvae are limited to the\nGI tract and the lungs, whereas in disseminated strongyloidiasis the larvae\ninvade numerous organs. A variety of systemic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary,\nand neurologic signs/symptoms have been documented; complications can be\nsevere. Left untreated, the mortality rates of hyperinfection syndrome and\ndisseminated strongyloidiasis can approach 90%.\n\nThe subcutaneous migration of filariform larvae in the autoinfective cycle, or\n“larva currens”, presents as a recurrent serpiginous maculopapular or\nurticarial rash along the buttocks, perineum, and thighs due to repeated\nautoinfection. This rash usually advances very rapidly (up to 10 cm/hr).\n\nIn infants infected with _S. fuelleborni_ subsp. _kellyi,_ a severe, often\nfatal, systemic illness involving protein-losing enteropathy has been\ndescribed, which sometimes presents with peritoneal ascites (“swollen belly\nsyndrome”)_._\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nStrongyloidiasis is usually diagnosed by microscopic identification of\n_Strongyloides stercoralis_ larvae (rhabditiform and occasionally filariform)\nin the stool, duodenal fluid, and/or biopsy specimens, and possibly sputum in\ndisseminated infections. Examination of serial samples may be necessary, and\nnot always sufficient, because infection burden is often low, larval output is\nminimal in uncomplicated infections, and microscopic examination of stool has\nlow sensitivity.\n\n_S. fuelleborni-_ strongyloidiasis is diagnosed based on detection of eggs in\nstool, though hatched rhabditiform larvae may be present if processing is\ndelayed. _S. fuelleborni_ subsp. _fuelleborni_ eggs are passed individually in\nstool and hatch rapidly;_S. fuelleborni_ subsp. _kellyi_ eggs are often passed\nwithin microscopic strings of mucous in the feces. Eggs of both species are\nsmaller than those of hookworms (45—55 x 30—35 µm) have a thin shell and are\npassed containing larvae which fill the egg and are in at least the cleaved\nstage of development.\n\nThe stool can be examined in wet mounts, either directly or after\nconcentration (note that formalin-ethyl acetate concentration may remove\nlarvae and reduce sensitivity). Larvae are best visualized following recovery\nby the Baermann funnel sedimentation technique or after culture using Koga\nagar plate, charcoal culture or the Harada-Mori filter paper technique. The\nKoga agar plate culture method is recognized in most studies as being the most\nsensitive coprological method for the detection of _Strongyloides_ larvae.\n\nAspiration of duodenal fluid or use of the less invasive Entero-test (commonly\ncalled a string test) may be useful to detect larvae in patients with negative\nstool samples. In disseminated strongyloidiasis, filariform larvae may be\ndetected in sputum, bronchial washings or pleural fluid. Patient with rashes\nmay have larvae identified on skin biopsy.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites.](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n### Antibody Detection\n\nImmunodiagnostic tests for strongyloidiasis are indicated when infection is\nsuspected and the organism is not detected by duodenal aspiration, string\ntests, or by repeated examinations of stool. Most antibody detection tests\nemploy antigens derived from _Strongyloides stercoralis_ (or from closely-\nrelated _S. ratti_ or _S. venezuelensis_) filariform larvae, although\nrecombinant antigens such as (e.g. NIE, SsIR) are increasingly being used.\nAlthough indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), indirect hemagglutination (IHA)\nand antigen-linked fluorescent and magnetic bead tests are are available,\nenzyme immunoassay (EIA) is recommended because of its greater sensitivity.\nThe filariform antigen-based EIA used at CDC has a sensitivity of 96% and a\nspecificity of 98%. The commercial EIA kits that are currently available have\ncomparable specificity but slightly lower sensitivity.\n\nImmunocompromised persons with disseminated strongyloidiasis usually have\ndetectable IgG antibodies despite their immunosuppression, though false\nnegative results can occur. Cross-reactions in patients with filariasis,\nschistosomiasis, and ascariasis may also occur, depending on the antigen used.\nCross-reactivity to sera from _S. fuelleborni_ -infected patients probably\noccurs, but performance has not been evaluated.\n\nA positive serologic test result warrants continuing efforts to establish a\nparasitological diagnosis followed by anthelminthic treatment, as positive\nserology does not differentiate between past and current infection.\nSerological reversion to antibody negative status is unusual in most\nstrongyloidiasis patients, although antibody levels decrease markedly within 6\nmonths after successful chemotherapy. Thus, serologic monitoring may be useful\nin the follow-up of treated patients.\n\n### Molecular Detection\n\nPCR and LAMP methods may be used to detect strongyloidiasis in fresh, frozen,\nor non-formalin fixed stool specimens. Sensitivity and specificity vary\ndepending on the reference test used to calculate such characteristics; false\nnegatives and false positives do occur.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool specimens apply. Unfixed stools and/or larval\ncoprocultures should be handled with caution to avoid percutaneous exposure to\nfilariform larvae. Agar plate cultures should be sealed with parafilm or\nmasking tape prior to incubation. Because filariform larvae often migrate to\ncondensation droplets on the lids of agar plate cultures care should be taken\nwhen reading cultures or opening culture plates. PPE including gloves, gowns,\nand eyewear should always be worn when working with samples potentially\ncontaining live larvae. Lugol’s iodine (1% povidine iodine; 10,000 ppm) or\n70-100% ethanol may be used to kill _S. stercoralis_ infective larvae on\nexposed skin and 70% ethanol may be used to disinfect contaminated surfaces.\n\n",
