  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nBursate nematodes in the genus, _Oesophagostomum_. _Oesophagostomum bifurcum_\nis the most-common species infecting humans in Africa.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/oesophagostomiasis/modules/Oesophagostomum_LifeCycle.gif?_=02439)\n\nCommon livestock such as sheep, goats, and swine, as well as non-human\nprimates, are the usual definitive hosts for _Oesophagostomum_ spp., but other\nanimals, including humans and cattle, may also serve as definitive hosts. Eggs\nare shed in the feces of the definitive host ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif),\nand may be indistinguishable from the eggs of _Necator_ and _Ancylostoma_.\nEggs hatch into _rhabditiform_ (L1) larvae in the environment ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif), given\nappropriate temperature and level of humidity. In the environment, the larvae\nwill undergo two molts and become infective filariform (L3) larvae ![The\nnumber 3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif).\nWorms can go from eggs to L3 larvae in a matter of a few days, given\nappropriate environmental conditions. Definitive hosts become infected after\ningesting infective L3 larvae ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif). After\ningestion, L3 larvae burrow into the submucosa of the large or small intestine\nand induce cysts. Within these cysts, the larvae molt and become L4 larvae.\nThese L4 larvae migrate back to the lumen of the large intestine, where they\nmolt into adults ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif),\n. Eggs appear in the feces of the definitive host about a month after\ningestion of infective L3 larvae.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Oesophagostomum_ spp. are widely distributed wherever livestock is raised,\nbut more common in the tropics and subtropics. The highest incidence in humans\nis in the northern regions of Togo and Ghana, where _O. bifurcum_ (primarily a\nmonkey parasite) appears to cycle naturally in the human populations. Sporadic\ncases in humans have also been recorded in Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, French\nGuiana, and West Africa\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nAcute abdomen is the most-common manifestation in humans, mimicking an\nappendicitis. A low-grade fever and tenderness in the lower-right quadrant are\nthe most-common symptoms; vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea are less-common.\nIntestinal obstruction may also occur, mimicking a hernia. Patients may also\npresent with large, painless cutaneous masses in the lower abdominal region.\nIn rare instances, _Oesophagostomum_ spp. will perforate the bowel wall,\ncausing purulent peritonitis or migrate to the skin, producing cutaneous\nnodules.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### Eggs of _Oesophagostomum_ spp.\n\n_Oesophagostomum_ spp. are primarily parasites of livestock and non-human\nprimates, and humans tend to be only incidental hosts for parasites in this\ngenus. Eggs of _O. bifurcum_ , the most-common species infecting humans,\ncannot be differentiated morphologically from the eggs of _Necator_ or\n_Ancylostoma_ (eggs of other animal oesophagostome species tend to be larger\nthan typical hookworm eggs, however). The eggs of _O. bifurcum_ measure 60-75\nµm long by 35-40 µm wide. Eggs are often in a later stage of cleavage than\nhookworm species when shed in feces.\n\n![](/dpdx/oesophagostomiasis/images/1/Oesophagostomum_egg_A.jpg?_=02403)\n\nFigure A: Egg of _Oesophagostomum_ sp. in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n![](/dpdx/oesophagostomiasis/images/1/Oesophagostomum_egg_B.jpg?_=02401)\n\nFigure B: Egg of _Oesophagostomum_ sp. in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n##### L3 infective larvae of _Oesophagostomum_ spp.\n\nThe definitive hosts of _Oesophagostomum_ spp. become infected from the\ningestion of infective L3 larvae, which develop in the environment. L3 larvae\nare longer than the L3 larvae of hookworms, measuring 710-950 µm in length.\nThe intestine is made-up of alternating triangular-shaped cells (zigzag gut\ncells). The tail end has a long, thin, tapered sheath, with a considerable gap\nbetween the end of the tail and the end of the sheath.\n\n![](/dpdx/oesophagostomiasis/images/2/Oesophagostomum_L3_ZAF1.jpg?_=02427)\n\nFigure A: L3 larva of _Oesophagostomum_ sp., obtained via coproculture from\nthe feces of a baboon (Papio ursinus) in South Africa.

Notice the long tail space\n(arrow) and long, tapering tail sheath.\n\n##### Adults of _Oesophagostomum_ spp.\n\nAdults of _Oesophagostomum_ spp. are bursate nematodes, related to and\nmorphologically-similar to, the hookworms. Females measure 1.5-3.0 cm in\nlength; males are smaller. In both sexes, the anterior end has a cephalic\ninflation or vesicle, a transverse cephalic groove, and an oral opening\nguarded by external and internal leaf crowns (corona radiata). The cuticle is\nringed with transverse striations. The posterior end of the female is short\nand pointed; the male possesses a symmetrical bursa and paired, equal\nspicules. Adults reside in the large intestine of the definitive host.\n\n![](/dpdx/oesophagostomiasis/images/3/Oesophagostamum_BeaverA.jpg?_=02416)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _Oesophagostomum_ sp.\n\n![](/dpdx/oesophagostomiasis/images/3/Oesophagostomum_BAM_bursa1.jpg?_=02413)\n\nFigure E: Posterior end of male Oesophagostomum sp.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is difficult during routine ova and parasite (O&P) examinations of\nstool, due to the similarity of _Oesophagostomum_ eggs to the eggs of\n_Necator_ and _Ancylostoma_. Eggs tend to be shed in greater numbers during\ncases of oesophagostomiasis than hookworm infection, however. Finding an\nintact worm during surgery or in a biopsy specimen can provide a definitive\ndiagnosis.\n\n",
