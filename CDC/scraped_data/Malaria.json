  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nBlood parasites of the genus _Plasmodium_. There are approximately 156 named\nspecies of _Plasmodium_ which infect various species of vertebrates. Four\nspecies are considered true parasites of humans, as they utilize humans almost\nexclusively as a natural intermediate host: _P. falciparum, P. vivax, P.\novale_ and _P. malariae_. However, there are periodic reports of simian\nmalaria parasites being found in humans, most reports implicating _P.\nknowlesi_. At the time of this writing, it has not been determined if _P.\nknowlesi_ is being naturally transmitted from human to human via the mosquito,\nwithout the natural intermediate host (macaque monkeys, genus _Macaca_).\nTherefore, _P. knowlesi_ is still considered a zoonotic malaria.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/malaria/modules/malaria_LifeCycle.gif?_=05237)\n\nThe malaria parasite life cycle involves two hosts. During a blood meal, a\nmalaria-infected female _Anopheles_ mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the\nhuman host ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/Generic_1.gif).\nSporozoites infect liver cells ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/liver_2.gif) and mature\ninto schizonts ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/liver_3.gif), which\nrupture and release merozoites ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/liver_4.gif). (Of note,\nin _P. vivax_ and _P. ovale_ a dormant stage [hypnozoites] can persist in the\nliver and cause relapses by invading the bloodstream weeks, or even years\nlater.) After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic\nschizogony ![The letter\nA](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/liver_sq_a.gif)), the\nparasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic\nschizogony ![The letter\nB](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/heart_sq_b.gif)).\nMerozoites infect red blood cells ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/heart_5.gif). The ring\nstage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing merozoites\n![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/heart_6.gif). Some\nparasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) ![The\nnumber 7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/heart_7.gif).\nBlood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the\ndisease.\n\nThe gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are\ningested by an _Anopheles_ mosquito during a blood meal ![The number\n8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/Generic_8.gif). The\nparasites’ multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle\n![The letter\nC](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_sq_c.gif). While\nin the mosquito’s stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes\ngenerating zygotes ![The number\n9](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/Generic_9.gif). The\nzygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) ![The number\n10](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_10.gif) which\ninvade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts ![The\nnumber 11](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_11.gif).\nThe oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites ![The number\n12](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_12.gif), which\nmake their way to the mosquito’s salivary glands. Inoculation of the\nsporozoites into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nMalaria generally occurs in areas where environmental conditions allow\nparasite multiplication in the vector. Malaria today is usually restricted to\ntropical and subtropical areas and altitudes below 1,500 m., although in the\npast malaria was endemic in much of North America, Europe and even parts of\nnorthern Asia, and today is still present on the Korean peninsula. However,\nthis present distribution could be affected by climatic changes and population\nmovements. _Plasmodium falciparum_ is the predominant species in the world.\n_P. vivax_ and _P. ovale_ are traditionally thought to occupy complementary\nniches, with _P. ovale_ predominating in Sub-Saharan Africa and _P. vivax_ in\nthe other areas; but their geographical ranges do overlap. These two species\nare not always distinguishable on the basis of morphologic characteristics\nalone, and the use of molecular tools will help clarify their diagnosis and\nexact distribution. _P. malariae_ has wide global distribution, being found in\nSouth America, Asia, and Africa, but it is less frequent than _P. falciparum_\nin terms of association with cases of infection. _P. knowlesi_ is found in\nsoutheast Asia.\n\nMore on: [Malaria Risk Information and Prophylaxis by\nCountry](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/preparing/yellow-fever-\nvaccine-malaria-prevention-by-country/#5853)\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe symptoms of uncomplicated malaria can be rather non-specific and the\ndiagnosis can be missed if health providers are not alert to the possibility\nof this disease. Since untreated malaria can progress to severe forms that may\nbe rapidly (<24 hours) fatal, malaria should always be considered in patients\nwho have a history of exposure (mostly: past travel or residence in disease-\nendemic areas). The most frequent symptoms include fever and chills, which can\nbe accompanied by headache, myalgias, arthralgias, weakness, vomiting, and\ndiarrhea. Other clinical features include splenomegaly, anemia,\nthrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, pulmonary or renal dysfunction, and neurologic\nchanges. The clinical presentation can vary substantially depending on the\ninfecting species, the level of parasitemia, and the immune status of the\npatient. Infections caused by _P. falciparum_ are the most likely to progress\nto severe, potentially fatal forms with central nervous system involvement\n(cerebral malaria), acute renal failure, severe anemia, or acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome. Other species can also have severe manifestations.\nComplications of _P. vivax_ malaria include splenomegaly (with, rarely,\nsplenic rupture), and those of _P. malariae_ include nephrotic syndrome.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "_**Plasmodium falciparum**_\n\n##### Ring-form trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in thick and a thin blood\nsmear.\n\nRing-form trophozoites (rings) of _Plasmodium falciparum_ are often thin and\ndelicate, measuring on average 1/5 the diameter of the red blood cell. Rings\nmay possess one or two chromatin dots. They may be found on the periphery of\nthe RBC (accolé, appliqué) and multiply-infected RBCs are not uncommon. Ring\nforms may become compact or pleomorphic depending on the quality of the blood\nor if there is a delay in making smears.

Image courtesy of\nthe Arizona State Public Health Laboratory.\n\n##### Ring-form trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in thin blood smears\nexhibiting Maurer’s clefts.\n\nMaurer’s clefts can be seen in _P. falciparum_ infections containing older\nring-form trophozoites and asexual stages. Maurer’s clefts resemble the\nSchüffner’s dots seen in _P. vivax_ and _P. ovale_ , but are usually larger\nand more coarse. Visualization of these structures is dependent on the quality\nof the smear preparation and the pH of the Giemsa stain. Like Schüffner’s\ndots, Maurer’s clefts appear to play a role in the metabolic pathways of the\ninfected RBCs.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/2/Pf_MaurersA.jpg?_=05348)\n\nFigure A: Ring-form trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear,\nexhibiting Maurer's clefts.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/2/Pf_MaurersE.jpg?_=05341)\n\nFigure E: Ring-form trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear,\nexhibiting Maurer's clefts.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/2/Pf_MaurersB.jpg?_=05346)\n\nFigure B: Ring-form trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear,\nexhibiting Maurer's clefts.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/2/Pf_MaurersF.jpg?_=05344)\n\nFigure F: Ring-form trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear,\nexhibiting Maurer's clefts.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/2/Pf_MaurersC.jpg?_=05342)\n\nFigure C: Ring-form trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear,\nexhibiting Maurer's clefts.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/2/Pf_MaurersD.jpg?_=05339)\n\nFigure D: Ring-form trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear,\nexhibiting Maurer's clefts.\n\n##### Developing and older trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in thick and a thin\nblood smear.\n\nDeveloping trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ tend to remain in ring form, but\nmay become thicker and more compact. The amount of pigment and chromatin may\nalso increase. Compact or amoeboid forms may be seen in smears where there was\na delay in processing the blood.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/3/Pf_troph_thickA.jpg?_=05391)\n\nFigure A: Trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thick blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/3/Pf_troph_thinD.jpg?_=05383)\n\nFigure E: Trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/3/Pf_troph_thinA.jpg?_=05388)\n\nFigure B: Trophozoite of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/3/Pf_troph_thinE.jpg?_=05380)\n\nFigure F: Trophozoites of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/3/Pf_troph_thinB.jpg?_=05392)\n\nFigure C: Trophozoite of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/3/Pf_troph_thinC.jpg?_=05386)\n\nFigure D: Trophozoite of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear. In this\nfigure, a gametocyte can also be seen in the upper half of the image.\n\n##### Gametocytes of _P. falciparum_ in thick and a thin blood smear.\n\nGametocytes of _Plasmodium falciparum_ are crescent- or sausage-shaped, and\nare usually about 1.5 times the diameter of an RBC in length. The cytoplasm of\nthe macrogametocytes (female) are usually a darker, deeper blue; the cytoplasm\nof the microgametocytes (male) is usually more pale. The red chromatin and\npigment is more coarse and concentrated in the macrogametocytes than the\nmicrogametocytes. Sometimes in thin blood smears, the remnants of the host RBC\ncan be seen; this is often referred to as Laveran’s bib.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/4/Pf_gametocyte_thickA.jpg?_=05313)\n\nFigure A: Gametocyte of _P. falciparum_ in a thick blood smear.

When seen, schizonts contain anywhere from\n8-24 merozoites. A mature schizont usually fills about 2/3 of the infected\nRBC.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/5/Pf_schizont_thinA.jpg?_=05350)\n\nFigure A: Schizont of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/5/Pf_schizont_thinB.jpg?_=05352)\n\nFigure B: Schizont of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/5/Pf_schizont_thinC.jpg?_=05354)\n\nFigure C: Schizont of _P. falciparum_ in a thin blood smear.

Appliqué forms may\nappear, as well as rectangular rings harboring one or more accessory chromatin\ndots. Red blood cells may also be multiply-infected. When full-grown, non-\namoeboid rings may occupy half or more of the host RBC.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/6/Pk_rings_thin_NY1.jpg?_=05406)\n\nFigure A: Ring-form trophozoites of _P. knowlesi_ in a Giemsa-stained thin\nblood smear from a human patient that traveled to the Philippines.

Image\ncourtesy of the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health.\n\n##### Older, developing trophozoites of _P. knowlesi_ in a thin blood smear.\n\nIn developing trophozoites of _P. knowlesi_ , band forms may appear that are\nsimilar in appearance to _P. malariae_. As the vacuole is lost during\nmaturation of the trophozoite stage, the parasite becomes smaller and more\ncompact. The pigment appears as dark grains and the red nucleus increases in\nsize. Stippling appears, often referred to as ‘Sinton and Mulligan’s’\nstippling, as it is not of the Schüffner type.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/7/Pk_troph_thin_NY1.jpg?_=05431)\n\nFigure A: Band-form trophozoite of _P. knowlesi_ in a Giemsa-stained thin\nblood smear from a human patient that traveled to the Philippines.

The cytoplasm stains blue and the eccentric nucleus stains red.\nPigment is coarse and black, and is scattered irregularly in the cytoplasm.\nThe microgametocyte is often, but not always, smaller than the\nmacrogametocyte. The cytoplasm usually stains a pale pink, while the nucleus\nstains a darker red. The nucleus may make up half the parasite. The coarse,\nblack pigment is scattered irregularly thought the cytoplasm.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/8/Pk_gametocyte_thin_NY1.jpg?_=05394)\n\nFigure A: Gametocyte of _P. knowlesi_ in a Giemsa-stained thin blood smear\nfrom a patient that traveled to the Philippines.

The\nnucleus continues to divide until there are up to 16 (average 10) merozoites.\nAs the schizont matures, it fills the host RBC and the pigment collects into\none or a few masses. In the mature schizont, the merozoites may appear\n‘segmented’ and the pigment has collected into a single mass.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/9/Pk_schizont_thin_NY1.jpg?_=05456)\n\nFigure A: Mature schizont in a Giemsa-stained thin blood smear from a patient\nthat traveled to the Philippines.Images courtesy of the Wadsworth Center, New\nYork State Department of Health.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/9/Pk_schizont_thin_NY5.jpg?_=05450)\n\nFigure E: Developing schizont in a Giemsa-stained thin blood smear from the\nsame patient as Figures A-D.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/9/Pk_schizont_thin_NY2.jpg?_=05452)\n\nFigure B: Mature schizont in a Giemsa-stained thin blood smear from a patient\nthat traveled to the Philippines.

Pigment granules become larger and tend to have a more peripheral\narrangement.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/13/Pm_basketA.jpg?_=05485)\n\nFigure A: Basket-form trophozoite of _P. malariae_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/13/Pm_basketB.jpg?_=05487)\n\nFigure B: Basket-form trophozoite of _P. malariae_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n![](/dpdx/malaria/images/13/Pm_basketC.jpg?_=05483)\n\nFigure C: Basket-form trophozoite of _P. malariae_ in a thin blood smear.\n\n##### Gametocytes of _P. malariae_ in thick and a thin blood smear.\n\nGametocytes of _P. malariae_ are compact and tend to fill the host RBC.

The sing rings may be\ndifficult to differentiate from _P. vivax_ , as the cytoplasm is usually thick\nwith a large chromatin dot.

In such cases, the _Plasmodium_ species can be determined by using\nconfirmatory molecular diagnostic tests. In addition, molecular tests such as\nPCR can detect parasites in specimens where the parasitemia may be below the\ndetectable level of blood film examination. The methods currently used at CDC\nare described below.\n\n##### Species-specific PCR diagnosis of malaria\n\n_Plasmodium_ genomic DNA is extracted from 200 µl whole blood using the QIAamp\nBlood Kit (Cat. No. 29106; Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA.) or a similar product\nthat can yield the comparable concentration of genomic DNA from the same\nvolume of blood.\n\nDetection and identification of _Plasmodium_ to the species level is done with\na real-time PCR assay as described by Rougemont et al 2004. This is a dual\nduplex assay that detects _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ in one reaction, and\n_P. malariae_ and _P. ovale_ in a parallel reaction, using species-specific\nTaqMan probes. In cases where infection by more than one _Plasmodium_ species\nis suspected, there is an option to use a conventional nested PCR assay\n(Snounou el al, 1993) that has an improved resolution of mixed infection\ncompared to the real-time PCR assay.\n\nAgarose gel (2%) analysis of a PCR diagnostic test for species-specific\ndetection of _Plasmodium_ DNA. PCR was performed using nested primers of\nSnounou et al.1\n\n  * **Lane S:** Molecular base pair standard (50-bp ladder). Black arrows show the size of standard bands.\n  * **Lane 1:** The red arrow shows the diagnostic band for _P. vivax_ (size: 120 bp).\n  * **Lane 2:** The red arrow shows the diagnostic band for _P. malariae_ (size: 144 bp).\n  * **Lane 3:** The red arrow shows the diagnostic band for _P. falciparum_ (size: 205 bp).\n  * **Lane 4:** The red arrow shows the diagnostic band for _P. ovale_ (size: 800 bp).\n\n###### Reference:\n\nMathieu Rougemont, Madeleine Van Saanen, Roland Sahli, Hans Peter Hinrikson,\nJacques Bille and Katia Jaton.

The IFA procedure can be used as a\ndiagnostic tool to determine if a patient has been infected with _Plasmodium_.\nBecause of the time required for development of antibody and also the\npersistence of antibodies, serologic testing is not practical for routine\ndiagnosis of acute malaria. However, antibody detection may be useful for:\n\n  * screening blood donors involved in cases of transfusion-induced malaria when the donor’s parasitemia may be below the detectable level of blood film examination\n  * testing a patient who has been recently treated for malaria but in whom the diagnosis is questioned\n\nSpecies-specific testing is available for the four human species: _P.\nfalciparum_ , _P. vivax_ , _P. malariae_ , and _P. ovale_. Cross reactions\noften occur between _Plasmodium_ species and _Babesia_ species. Blood stage\n_Plasmodium_ species schizonts (meronts) are used as antigen. The patient’s\nserum is exposed to the organisms; homologous antibody, if present, attaches\nto the antigen, forming an antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) complex. Fluorescein-\nlabeled antihuman antibody is then added, which attaches to the patient’s\nmalaria-specific antibodies. When examined with a fluorescence microscope, a\npositive reaction is when the parasites fluoresce an apple green color.\n\n###### Reference:\n\nSulzer AJ, and Wilson M. The fluorescent antibody test for malaria. Crit Rev\nClin Lab Sci 1971;2:601-609.\n\n#### Antigen Detection\n\nIn addition to microscopy and molecular methods, there are methods for\ndetecting malaria parasites on the basis of antigens or enzymatic activities\nassociated with the parasites. These methods are often packaged as individual\ntest kits called rapid diagnostic tests or RDTs.\n\nThese methods include, among others:\n\n  * detection of an antigen (histidine rich protein-2, HRP-2) associated with malaria parasites (_P. falciparum_)\n  * detection of a _Plasmodium_ specific aldolase\n  * detection of a _Plasmodium_ associated lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) either through its enzymatic activity or by immunoassay\n\nThere is currently only one RDT licensed for use in the United States. For\nadditional information visit <https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/hcp/diagnosis-\ntesting/malaria-diagnostic-tests.html>\n\n#### Additional Guidance\n\nPatients suspected of having an orthoebolavirus or orthomarburgvirus after\ntravel to an area experiencing an Ebola or Marburg outbreak should be\nevaluated urgently for malaria infection as the symptoms of malaria infection\nare very similar to those of\n[Ebola](https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/about/index.html) and\n[Marburg](https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/about/). CDC provides [guidance for\nmalaria diagnosis in patients with suspected orthoebolavirus or\northomarburgvirus infection in the United\nStates](/dpdx/malaria/malaria_ebola.html).\n\n#### Bench Aids\n\n[![Preparation of Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_procedures_benchaid.jpg)](/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_procedures_benchaid.pdf)\n\n[Preparation of Blood\nSmears](/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_procedures_benchaid.pdf)\n\n[![Staining for Malaria\nParasites](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_staining_benchaid.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_staining_benchaid.pdf)\n\n[Staining for Malaria\nParasites](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_staining_benchaid.pdf)\n\n[![Laboratory Diagnosis of Plasmodium\nfalciparum](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pfalciparum_benchaidV2.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pfalciparum_benchaidV2.pdf)\n\n[Laboratory Diagnosis of _Plasmodium\nfalciparum_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pfalciparum_benchaidV2.pdf)\n\n[![Laboratoy Diagnosis of Plasmodium\nvivax](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pvivax_benchaidV2.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pvivax_benchaidV2.pdf)\n\n[Laboratoy Diagnosis of _Plasmodium\nvivax_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pvivax_benchaidV2.pdf)\n\n[![Preparation of Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Povale_benchaidV2.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Povale_benchaidV2.pdf)\n\n[Laboratory Diagnosis of _Plasmodium\novale_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Povale_benchaidV2.pdf)\n\n[![Preparation of Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pmalariae_benchaidV2.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pmalariae_benchaidV2.pdf)\n\n[Laboratory Diagnosis of _Plasmodium\nmalariae_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Pmalariae_benchaidV2.pdf)\n\n[![Preparation of Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p1-2.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p1-2.pdf)\n\n[Comparison of the _Plasmodium_ Species Which Cause Human\nMalaria](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p1-2.pdf)\n\n[![Preparation of Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p3-6.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p3-6.pdf)\n\n[_Plasmodium falciparum_ Blood Stage Parasites, Thin Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p3-6.pdf)\n\n[![Preparation of Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p7-8.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p7-8.pdf)\n\n[_Plasmodium falciparum_ Blood Stage Parasites, Thick Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_Comparison_p7-8.pdf)\n\n[![Preparation of Blood\nSmears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Parasitemia_and_LifeCycle.jpg)](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Parasitemia_and_LifeCycle.pdf)\n\n[Calculating Percent Parasitemia and Life Cycle of _Plasmodium_\nSpecies](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Parasitemia_and_LifeCycle.pdf)\n\n",
