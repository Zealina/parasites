  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nCoenurosis is infection with the metacestode larval stage (coenurus; plural\ncoenuri) of coenurus-forming _Taenia_ species, including\n_Taenia_(_=Multiceps_)_multiceps_ , _T. serialis,_ _T. brauni_ , and _T.\nglomeratus._ Of these, _T. multiceps_ is the most commonly implicated species.\nUnlike the other prevalent human-infecting _Taenia_ species, humans do not\nsupport the maturation of these cestodes (tapeworms) in the intestine and only\nexperience tissue infections with coenuri e). These species are sometimes\ncalled “bladder worms” due to the shape of the coenurus.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/coenurosis/modules/Coenurosis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=41988)](/dpdx/coenurosis/modules/Coenurosis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/coenurosis/modules/Coenurosis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nEggs and gravid proglottids are shed in feces of the infected definitive host\n(canids) into the environment\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) , where they are\nimmediately infectious and may be ingested by an intermediate host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Eggs hatch in the\nintestine of the intermediate host and oncospheres are released\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) that circulate in blood\nuntil they lodge in suitable organs (including skeletal muscle, eyes, brain\nand subcutaneous tissue). After about three months, oncospheres develop into\ncoenuri, which contain numerous protoscolices. The definitive host becomes\ninfected by ingesting the tissue of an infected intermediate host containing a\ncoenurus ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The\nprotoscolices evert, attach to the small intestinal wall\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) , and develop into adult\ncestodes in the definitive canid host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) .\n\nHumans become infected after the accidental ingestion of eggs on fomites or in\nfood and water contaminated by feces of the infected definitive host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . Eggs hatch in the\nintestine, and oncospheres are released\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) that circulate in blood\nuntil they lodge in suitable organs and after about three months develop into\ncoenuri ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) . Coenuri of _T.\nmulticeps_ are usually found in the eyes and brain; those of _T. serialis_ are\nusually found in subcutaneous tissue.\n\n### Hosts\n\nThe definitive hosts for _Taenia multiceps_ and _T. serialis_ are members of\nthe family Canidae. Many canids can serve as definitive hosts for _T.\nmulticeps_ , but only dogs and foxes can serve as hosts for _T. serialis_.\nSheep are a common intermediate host for _T. multiceps,_ and rabbits for _T.\nserialis,_ although many other herbivorous species can also serve as\nintermediate hosts.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWidespread; most of the human cases are from Africa, although cases also\nappear in sheep-raising areas of Europe, South America, the United States, and\nCanada. _T. brauni_ and _T. glomerulatus_ cases have occurred in Africa only.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThere is not a well-defined clinical syndrome for coenurosis; presentation\nwill depend on the location and extent of the coenuri. Coenuri in the skin or\nsubcutaneous tissue usually present as painless nodules, which may be\nfluctuant and tender. Most subcutaneous nodules manifest on the torso, sclera,\nsubconjuctiva, neck, shoulders, head, and limbs. Coenuri in the neck may\naffect neck movement and swallowing, and central nervous system-associated\ncoenuri may present with variable neurologic signs/symptoms similar to\ncysticercosis. Coenuri in the eye cause both intraocular and orbital\ninfections with varying degrees of visual impairment. Obstructive jaundice has\nbeen observed in some cases where coenuri are found intraperitoneally.\nClinically, coenuri may mimic lymphomas, lipomas, neurofibromas, or\npseudotumors. Coenurosis should be distinguished from other tissue cestodiases\nincluding cysticercosis, hydatid disease/echinococcosis, and sparganosis.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "Gross coenurus specimens.  \n\nCoenurosis is infection by the metacestode larval stage (coenurus) of _Taenia\nmulticeps_ and _T. serialis_. Coenuri may be found in most tissue types, but\nthose of _T. multiceps_ have a predilection for the central nervous system and\neye; those of _T. serialis_ are usually found in subcutaneous tissue. Coenuri\nare thin-walled, whitish or gray, and spherical to polycephalic in shape. The\ncommon name “bladder worm” derives from the gross appearance, resembling a\nfluid-filled bladder. A coenurus contains multiple protoscolices; this\ndistinguishes it from a cysticercus, which contains a single protoscolex.\nAlso, the length of the large hooklets on the protoscolices can be useful in\nseparating cysticerci from coenuri: the long hooklets of a metacestode of _T.\nserialis_ and _T. multiceps_ measure 110–175 µm long; those of _T. solium\nmeasure_ 100—130 µm long. _T. multiceps_ protoscolices are scattered\nirregularly within the coenurus, and _T. serialis_ and _T. brauni_ have a more\nlinear arrangement.\n\n![](/dpdx/coenurosis/images/1/Coenurus_BAM2.jpg?_=01842)\n\nFigure A: Large, polycephalic coenurus removed from the shoulder of a baboon\n(Papio sp.).\n\n![](/dpdx/coenurosis/images/1/Coenurus_BAM3.jpg?_=01840)\n\nFigure B: Close-up of a coenurus of _T. multiceps_ removed from the eye of a\npatient, broken open to show multiple protoscolices.\n\nCoenuri in tissue specimens, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\n\n![](/dpdx/coenurosis/images/2/tissue_coen_A.jpg?_=41521)\n\nFigure A: Coenurus removed from a subcutaneous nodule on the leg of a patient,\nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is made by the observation of coenuri in biopsy or autopsy\nspecimens. Coenuri are usually readily distinguished from cysticerci by the\npresence of multiple protoscolices. The use of serology in diagnosis remains\nexperimental.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard laboratory precautions for the [processing of tissue\nspecimens](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/other/tissue.html) apply.\n\n",
