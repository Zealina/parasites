  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\n_Loa loa_ , a filarid nematode commonly referred to as the African eye worm.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifeCycle](/dpdx/loiasis/modules/L_loa_LifeCycle.gif?_=02232)\n\nThe vector for _Loa loa_ filariasis are flies from two species of the genus\n_Chrysops_ , _C. silacea_ and _C. dimidiata_. During a blood meal, an infected\nfly (genus _Chrysops_ , day-biting flies) introduces third-stage filarial\nlarvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite\nwound ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif). The\nlarvae develop into adults that commonly reside in subcutaneous tissue ![The\nnumber 2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif).\nThe female worms measure 40 to 70 mm in length and 0.5 mm in diameter, while\nthe males measure 30 to 34 mm in length and 0.35 to 0.43 mm in diameter.\nAdults produce microfilariae measuring 250 to 300 µm by 6 to 8 μm, which are\nsheathed and have diurnal periodicity. Microfilariae have been recovered from\nspinal fluids, urine, and sputum. During the day they are found in peripheral\nblood, but during the noncirculation phase, they are found in the lungs ![The\nnumber 3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif).\nThe fly ingests microfilariae during a blood meal ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif). After\ningestion, the microfilariae lose their sheaths and migrate from the fly’s\nmidgut through the hemocoel to the thoracic muscles of the arthropod ![The\nnumber 5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif).\nThere the microfilariae develop into first-stage larvae ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_6.gif) and\nsubsequently into third-stage infective larvae ![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_7.gif). The\nthird-stage infective larvae migrate to the fly’s proboscis ![The number\n8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_8.gif) and can\ninfect another human when the fly takes a blood meal ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Loa loa_ is found in Africa.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nLoiasis is often asymptomatic. Episodic angioedema (Calabar swellings) and\nsubconjunctival migration of an adult worm can occur.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### Microfilariae of _Loa loa_.\n\nMicrofilariae of _Loa loa_ are sheathed and measure 230-250 µm long in stained\nblood smears and 270-300 µm in 2% formalin. The tail is tapered and nuclei\nextend to the tip of the tail. Microfilariae circulate in the blood.\n\n![](/dpdx/loiasis/images/1/L_loa_whole_HBc.jpg?_=02222)\n\nFigure A: Microfilaria of _L. loa_ a thick blood smear from a patient from\nCameroon, stained with Giemsa. Note the nuclei extending to the tip of the\ntail to the left of the image.\n\n![](/dpdx/loiasis/images/1/L_loa_whole_HBb.jpg?_=02214)\n\nFigure E: Microfilaria of _L. loa_ in a thin blood smear, stained with Giemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/loiasis/images/1/Loa1_1000x.jpg?_=02212)\n\nFigure B: Microfilaria of _L. loa_ in a thick blood smear, stained with\nGiemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/loiasis/images/1/L_loa_whole_HBa.jpg?_=02210)\n\nFigure F: Microfilaria of _L. loa_ in a thin blood smear, stained with Giemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/loiasis/images/1/Loa2_1000.jpg?_=02217)\n\nFigure C: Microfilaria of _L. loa_ in a thick blood smear, stained with\nGiemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/loiasis/images/1/Loa_knotts_100x.jpg?_=02219)\n\nFigure G: Microfilariae of _L. loa_ captured by the Knotts concentration\ntechnique.

Adult females\nare 40-70 mm in length and 0.45-0.60 mm wide; males are smaller at 30-34 mm\nlong and 0.35-0.40 mm wide. The exterior of the cuticle lacks ridging seen in\nmany _Dirofilaria_ but contains irregularly-spaced elevations called “bosses”.\n\n![](/dpdx/loiasis/images/2/L_loa_adult_GA1.jpg?_=02224)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _L. loa_ removed from the eye of a patient.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\n_Loa loa_ is usually diagnosed by the finding of microfilaria in peripheral\nblood smears or adults in the subconjunctiva. The blood films may be thick or\nthin and stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin-and-eosin. For increased\nsensitivity, concentration techniques can be used. These include\ncentrifugation of the blood sample lysed in 2% formalin ([Knott’s\ntechnique](https://www.cdc.gov/filarial-worms/testing/index.html)), or\nfiltration through a Nucleopore® membrane. Microfilariae of _L. loa_ exhibit\ndiurnal periodicity and a diagnosis is best made from blood collected during\nthe mid-day (10 AM-2 PM). The presence of Calabar swellings can aid in the\ndiagnosis.\n\n",
