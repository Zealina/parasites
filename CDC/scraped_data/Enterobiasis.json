  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nThe nematode (roundworm) _Enterobius vermicularis_ is widely known as the\nhuman pinworm due to the female’s long, pointed tail. In some areas the common\nnames “seatworm” and “threadworm” are used (the latter of which is sometimes\nalso used to refer to [_Strongyloides\nstercoralis_](/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/index.html))_._ Another putative pinworm\nspecies, _Enterobius gregorii_ , has been described and reported from humans\nin Europe, Africa, and Asia. However, further morphologic and molecular\nevidence suggests _E. gregorii_ likely represents an immature form of _E.\nvermicularis._ The rat pinworm, _Syphacia obvelata_ , has also very rarely\nbeen reported infecting humans.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/enterobiasis/modules/Enterobius_LifeCycl_19.jpg?_=58662)](/dpdx/enterobiasis/modules/Enterobius_LifeCycl_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/enterobiasis/modules/Enterobius_LifeCycl_lg.jpg)\n\nGravid adult female _Enterobius vermicularis_ deposit eggs on perianal folds\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Infection occurs via\nself-inoculation (transferring eggs to the mouth with hands that have\nscratched the perianal area) or through exposure to eggs in the environment\n(e.g. contaminated surfaces, clothes, bed linens, etc.)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Following ingestion of\ninfective eggs, the larvae hatch in the small intestine\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) and the adults establish\nthemselves in the colon, usually in the cecum\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The time interval from\ningestion of infective eggs to oviposition by the adult females is about one\nmonth. At full maturity adult females measure 8 to 13 mm, and adult males 2 to\n5 mm; the adult life span is about two months. Gravid females migrate\nnocturnally outside the anus and oviposit while crawling on the skin of the\nperianal area ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . The larvae\ncontained inside the eggs develop (the eggs become infective) in 4 to 6 hours\nunder optimal conditions ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) .\n\nRarely, eggs may become airborne and be inhaled and swallowed. Retroinfection,\nor the migration of newly hatched larvae from the anal skin back into the\nrectum, may occur but the frequency with which this happens is unknown.\n\n### Hosts\n\nOxyurid nematodes (pinworms) generally exhibit high host specificity. Humans\nare considered the only host for _E. vermicularis,_ although occasional\ninfections have been reported in captive chimpanzees _._\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_E. vermicularis_ occurs worldwide, with infections occurring most frequently\nin school- or preschool-children and in crowded conditions.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nEnterobiasis is frequently asymptomatic. The most typical symptom is perianal\npruritus, especially at night, which may lead to excoriations and bacterial\nsuperinfection. Occasionally, invasion of the female genital tract with\nvulvovaginitis and pelvic or peritoneal granulomas can occur. Other symptoms\ninclude, teeth grinding, enuresia, insomnia, anorexia, irritability, and\nabdominal pain, which can mimic appendicitis. _E. vermicularis_ larvae are\noften found within the appendix on appendectomy, but the role of this nematode\nin appendicitis remains controversial. Very rare instances of eosinophilic\ncolitis associated with _E. vermicularis_ larvae have been reported.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "**_Enterobius vermicularis_ eggs.**\n\nThe eggs of _Enterobius vermicularis_ measure 50—60 µm by 20—30 µm. They are\ntransparent, elongate to oval in shape, and slightly flattened on one side.\nThey are usually partially embryonated when shed. Enterobiasis can be\ndiagnosed by applying cellulose tape to the anus of a suspect patient,\nespecially in the morning before the patient’s first bowel movement. Eggs will\nadhere to the tape and can be seen microscopically.\n\n![](/dpdx/enterobiasis/images/1/Enterobius_cellulosetape.jpg?_=04216)\n\nFigure A: Eggs of _E. vermicularis_ in a cellulose-tape preparation.\n\n![](/dpdx/enterobiasis/images/1/Evermicularis_egg_HBa.jpg?_=04214)\n\nFigure B: Eggs of _E. vermicularis_ in a wet mount.\n\n![](/dpdx/enterobiasis/images/1/Evermicularis_egg_wtmt.jpg?_=04219)\n\nFigure C: Egg of _E. vermicularis_ in an iodine-stained wet mount from a\nformalin concentrate.

  "lab_diagnosis": "#### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs collected in the perianal area is the\nmethod of choice for diagnosing enterobiasis. To improve sensitivity,\ncollection should be done in the morning, before defecation and washing, by\npressing transparent cellulose tape (“Scotch test”, cellulose tape slide test)\non the perianal skin and then examining the tape placed on a microscope slide.\nAlternatively, anal swabs or “Swube tubes” (a paddle coated with adhesive\nmaterial) can also be used for collection. Eggs can also be found, but less\nfrequently, in the stool, and occasionally are encountered in the urine or\nvaginal smears. Adult worms are also diagnostic, when found in the perianal\narea, or during anorectal or vaginal examinations. In cases of ectopic\ninfection, eggs may be seen in the urine or in cervicovaginal Papanicolaou\nsmears.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites.](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n#### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) apply for\nprocessing stool samples (also tape test samples) to avoid accidental\ningestion of infectious eggs. Surfaces should be cleaned thoroughly as the\nouter coat of _E. vermicularis_ eggs is adhesive.\n\n",
