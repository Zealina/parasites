  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nThe trematodes _Fasciola hepatica_ (also known as the common liver fluke or\nthe sheep liver fluke) and _Fasciola gigantica_ are large liver flukes (_F.\nhepatica_ : up to 30 mm by 15 mm; _F. gigantica_ : up to 75 mm by 15 mm),\nwhich are primarily found in domestic and wild ruminants (their main\ndefinitive hosts) but also are causal agents of fascioliasis in humans.\n\nAlthough _F. hepatica_ and _F. gigantica_ are distinct species, “intermediate\nforms” that are thought to represent hybrids of the two species have been\nfound in parts of Asia and Africa where both species are endemic. These forms\nusually have intermediate morphologic characteristics (e.g. overall size,\nproportions), possess genetic elements from both species, exhibit unusual\nploidy levels (often triploid), and do not produce sperm. Further research\ninto the nature and origin of these forms is ongoing _._\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/fascioliasis/modules/Fasciola_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=11547)](/dpdx/fascioliasis/modules/Fasciola_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/fascioliasis/modules/Fasciola_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nImmature eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and passed in the stool\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Eggs become embryonated\nin freshwater over ~2 weeks\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) ; embryonated eggs release\nmiracidia ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) , which invade a\nsuitable snail intermediate host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . In the snail, the\nparasites undergo several developmental stages (sporocysts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4a.jpg) , rediae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4b.jpg) , and cercariae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4c.jpg) ). The cercariae are\nreleased from the snail ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg)\nand encyst as metacercariae on aquatic vegetation or other substrates. Humans\nand other mammals become infected by ingesting metacercariae-contaminated\nvegetation (e.g., watercress)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . After ingestion, the\nmetacercariae excyst in the duodenum\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) and penetrate through the\nintestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity. The immature flukes then migrate\nthrough the liver parenchyma into biliary ducts, where they mature into adult\nflukes and produce eggs ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) .\nIn humans, maturation from metacercariae into adult flukes usually takes about\n3–4 months; development of _F. gigantica_ may take somewhat longer than _F.\nhepatica_.\n\n### Hosts\n\n_Fasciola hepatica_ and _F. gigantica_ are primarily parasites of domestic and\nwild ruminants (most commonly, sheep, cattle, and goats; also, camelids,\ncervids, and buffalo). Infections occasionally occur in aberrant, non-ruminant\nherbivore hosts, including equids, lagomorphs, macropods, and rodents.\nDetection of _Fasciola_ spp. eggs in the feces of carnivores probably\nrepresents spurious passage following consumption of contaminated liver.\n\nThe snail intermediate hosts for _Fasciola_ spp. are in the family Lymnaeidae,\nparticularly species in the genera _Lymnaea, Galba, Fossaria,_ and\n_Pseudosuccinea._ At least 20 snail species have been identified as\nintermediate hosts for one or more _Fasciola_ spp. Snail species may differ\nwith respect to their suitability to serve as intermediate hosts for _F.\nhepatica_ versus _F. gigantica_ ; host ranges for both _Fasciola_ spp. are a\nsubject of ongoing research.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Fasciola hepatica_ is found on all inhabited continents, in more than 70\ncountries, particularly where sheep or cattle are raised. Human infections\nhave been reported in parts of Europe, the Middle East, Latin America (e.g.,\nBolivia and Peru), the Caribbean, Asia, Africa, and rarely in Australia.\nAlthough the conditions for _F. hepatica_ life cycle exist in the some parts\nof the United States, most of the reported U.S. cases of _F. hepatica_\ninfection in humans have occurred in immigrants who became infected in other\ncountries.\n\n_Fasciola gigantica_ is mainly found in tropical and subtropical regions.\nHuman cases have been reported in parts of Asia and Africa, as well as in\nHawaii and Iran.\n\n“Intermediate forms” have been reported from areas, particularly in Asia,\nwhere both _F. hepatica_ and _F. gigantica_ are endemic. However, other non-\nsperm-producing forms with unusual ploidy and morphology occasionally have\nbeen reported in areas where the two species are not sympatric (e.g., the\nUnited Kingdom), which underscores the need for more research into atypical\nforms.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n_Fasciola_ spp. infection in humans has two main phases, which may or may not\nbe associated with symptoms or other clinical manifestations. During the early\nphase of the infection (usually referred to as the **acute phase** ; also, the\nmigratory, invasive, hepatic, parenchymal, or larval phase), the period when\nthe larval fluke is migrating from the intestines and through the liver\nparenchyma, larval migration can be associated with inflammation, tissue\ndestruction, and toxic/allergic reactions. Nonspecific symptoms/signs (e.g.,\nabdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hepatomegaly, malaise, fever, cough) and\nlaboratory abnormalities (e.g., peripheral eosinophilia, elevated transaminase\nlevels) may develop. Occasionally, larval flukes migrate to ectopic sites,\nsuch as the lungs, subcutaneous tissue, pancreas, genitourinary tract, eyes,\nor brain.\n\nDuring the **chronic phase** of the infection (also referred to as the biliary\nor adult phase), clinical manifestations, if any, may develop months to years\npostexposure and include inflammation or blockage of bile ducts or the\ngallbladder (e.g., cholangitis, cholecystitis), which can be intermittent.\nInflammation of the pancreas may also occur.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### _Fasciola hepatica_ eggs.\n\nEggs of _Fasciola spp._ are broadly ellipsoidal, are operculated, measure\n130–150 µm long by 60–90 µm wide, and are passed unembryonated in feces.\n_Fasciola_ spp. eggs can be difficult to distinguish from _Fasciolopsis_\n_buski_ eggs, although the abopercular end of _Fasciola_ spp. eggs often have\na roughened or irregular area. Eggs are often reported as “\n_Fasciola/Fasciolopsis_ ” eggs due to morphologic overlap. Also, egg size\ncannot reliably distinguish _F. hepatica_ from _F. gigantica._\n\n![](/dpdx/fascioliasis/images/1/F_hepatica_egg_wtmt_HB1.jpg?_=05666)\n\nFigure A: Egg of _F. hepatica_ in an unstained wet mount, taken at 400x\nmagnification.\n\n![](/dpdx/fascioliasis/images/1/F_hepatica_egg_wtmt_HB2.jpg?_=05670)\n\nFigure B: Egg of _F. hepatica_ in an unstained wet mount, taken at 400x\nmagnification.\n\n![](/dpdx/fascioliasis/images/1/Fasciola_egg_2x2.jpg?_=05668)\n\nFigure C: Egg of _F. hepatica_ in an unstained wet mount.\n\n#####  _F. hepatica_ adults.\n\nAdults of _Fasciola hepatica_ are large and broadly-flattened, measuring up to\n30 mm long and 15 mm wide. The anterior end is cone-shaped, unlike the rounded\nanterior end of _Fasciolopsis buski_. Adults reside in the bile ducts of the\nliver in the definitive host.\n\n![](/dpdx/fascioliasis/images/2/Fasciola_adult_unstained1.jpg?_=05673)\n\nFigure A: Unstained adult of _F. hepatica_ fixed in formalin.\n\n![](/dpdx/fascioliasis/images/2/F_hepatica_adult_stained_BAM.jpg?_=05674)\n\nFigure B: Adult of _F. hepatica_ stained with carmine.\n\n#####  _F. hepatica_ adults observed in endoscopic retrograde\ncholangiopancreatography (ERCP).\n\nAdults of _Fasciola hepatica_ observed with endoscopic retrograde\ncholangiopancreatography (ERCP) imaging.\n\n![](/dpdx/fascioliasis/images/3/Fasciola_ERCP_India_A.jpg?_=05664)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _F. hepatica_ observed with ERCP imaging in the common bile\nduct of a human patient.

The species of snail can vary, in terms of\nlocation, habitat and elevation. In places where both _F. hepatica_ and _F.\ngigantica_ occur, each species of fluke has its own species or more of\nintermediate hosts.\n\n![](/dpdx/fascioliasis/images/4/Galba_trunculata_Poppe.jpg?_=05655)\n\nFigure A: Galba truncatula, the main intermediate host of _F. hepatica_\nthroughout most of the fluke's natural range in Europe and western Asia.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\nEggs can be detected by light microscopy during the chronic (adult) phase of\ninfection. Eggs can be recovered from stool or material obtained by duodenal\nor biliary drainage or aspiration. _F. hepatica_ _and_ _F. gigantica_ eggs are\neffectively morphologically indistinguishable and also can be difficult to\ndistinguish from (or can be confused with) eggs of _Fasciolopsis buski_ and\neggs of some _Echinostoma_ spp. Adult flukes may be detected with endoscopic\nretrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]). Migrating larval flukes may be\ndetected in histologic sections.\n\nFalse fascioliasis (pseudofascioliasis) refers to the presence of eggs in the\nstool not because of an actual infection but rather because of recent\ningestion of liver contaminated with eggs, which are not infective for humans.\nThe potential for misdiagnosis can be avoided by having the patient abstain\nfrom eating liver for several days before a repeat stool examination.\n\n[Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n#### Antibody Detection\n\nSerologic testing can be useful in the acute phase of infection because\nspecific antibodies to _Fasciola_ may become detectable 2 to 4 weeks after\nacquisition of infection, whereas egg production typically does not start\nuntil at least 3 to 4 months after exposure. Serologic testing can also be of\nvalue for cases of chronic _Fasciola_ infection in persons with low-level or\nsporadic egg production, as well as in persons with ectopic infection. It may\nalso help rule out pseudofascioliasis associated with ingestion of parasite\neggs in sheep or beef liver.\n\nThe typical approach for immunodiagnosis of human _F. hepatica_ infection\nincludes use of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with excretory-secretory (ES) or\nrecombinant antigens and confirmatory testing of EIA-positive specimens with\nan immunoblot assay.\n\nCDC has developed a CLIA-approved immunoblot assay for the diagnosis of\n_Fasciola_ infection, which is based on a recombinant _F. hepatica_ antigen\n(FhSAP2)*. A positive reaction is defined as the presence of a band at ~38\nkDa. The sensitivity of the assay is ≥94% (16/17) and the specificity is ≥98%\n(113/115) for humans with chronic _Fasciola_ infection. This assay has not yet\nbeen validated for acute _Fasciola_ infection.\n\n*Shin, S.H., Hsu, A., Chastain, H.M., Cruz, L.A., Elder, E.S., Sapp, S.G., McAuliffe, I., Espino, A.M. and Handali, S., 2016. Development of two FhSAP2 recombinant–based assays for immunodiagnosis of human chronic fascioliasis. _The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene_ , _95_(4), pp.852-855.\n\n#### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions apply for the processing of\n[stool](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html),\n[serum](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/serum/safety.html), and tissue specimens.\n_Fasciola_ spp. eggs cannot infect humans because of the need for larval\ndevelopment in an intermediate host (snail).\n\n",
