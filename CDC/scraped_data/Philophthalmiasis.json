  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nZoonotic trematodes in the genus _Philophthalmus_ , also called “eye flukes”,\nhave infected humans on very rare occasions. The three _Philophthalmus_\nspecies conclusively identified in humans are _P. lacrymosus_(also spelled _P.\nlachrymosus_ and _P. lacrimosus_)_, P. gralli,_ and _P. palpebrarum_. Note\nthat in most previously reported cases, species could not be ascertained.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/philophthalmiasis/modules/Philophthalmus_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=09707)](/dpdx/philophthalmiasis/modules/Philophthalmus_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/philophthalmiasis/modules/Philophthalmus_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nAdult flukes in the avian definitive host’s ocular orbit release embryonated\neggs, which are then introduced into water sources by the host (e.g. during\ndiving, aquatic foraging, or drinking)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Miracidia hatch almost\nimmediately in water ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) and\npenetrate the snail intermediate host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . Inside the snail host,\npre-formed sporocysts within the miracidia produce generations of rediae,\nwhich become cercariae ( ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3a.jpg)\n, ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3b.jpg) ). Cercariae are\nreleased from the snail ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg)\nand encyst on stationary objects in water (e.g. vegetation, shells of mollusks\nand crustaceans) and become flask-shaped metacercariae; no second intermediate\nhost is involved, as in many other trematodes\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . The definitive host,\nwhich is usually an aquatic bird, becomes infected either upon ingestion of\nmetacercariae or by direct exposure of the eye to cercariae or metacercariae\nin water ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . When ingested,\nmetacercariae excyst almost instantly in the mouth and migrate through the\nnasal passages to the ocular orbit over few days. Adult flukes are found in\nthe conjunctival sac, either around the lachrymal glands or under/on the\nsurface of the nictitating membrane\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . Human infections are\nextremely rare, and the route of infection is not entirely clear. Direct entry\nof cercariae or metacercariae into the orbit following exposure during bathing\nor swimming in fresh water seems likely based on some case histories, although\noral inoculation cannot be ruled out\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) .  \n\n### Hosts\n\nThe majority of _Philophthalmus_ species are associated with waterbirds and\nwading birds (e.g., gulls, ducks, geese, herons) although other avian species\nare capable of being infected under experimental conditions. Aberrant\ninfections have also been achieved experimentally or observed naturally among\nsome mammals, such as rabbits, rats, and non-human primates. All species that\nhave been identified in human infections (_P. lacrymosus, P. gralli,_ _P.\npalpebrarum_) use avian hosts.\n\nSnail intermediate hosts are diverse and include freshwater and marine\nspecies. Introduced, invasive snail species may be responsible for the spread\nof _Philophthalmus_ spp. to new locations. For many species, the snail host\nrange is not known. _Melanoides tuberculata_ appears to be the primary\nintermediate host for _P. gralli._\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nVarious _Philophthalmus_ species occur worldwide in avian hosts. Human cases\nhave been reported from North America, Central Europe, the Middle East, East\nAsia, and South Asia.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe clinical course of philophthalmiasis in humans has not been well described\ndue to its rarity. The presence of adult flukes in the orbit causes\nconjunctivitis, keratitis, watery discharge, and mild edema.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "**_Philophthalmus gralli_ adults**\n\n_Philophthalmus_ spp. are small, somewhat elongate trematodes, usually\nmeasuring from 2–5 mm in length and 1.5 mm in maximum width (varying by\nspecies). Major features are large, muscular oral and ventral suckers, large\npharynx, and a long, prominent cirrus pouch.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is based on the recovery and identification of adult flukes from the\nocular orbit. Genus/species identification requires expertise in trematode\nmorphology.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nUniversal laboratory precautions apply, as only adult fluke specimens are\nlikely to be examined in a diagnostic setting.\n\n",
