  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nSeveral members of the cestode (tapeworm) family Diphyllobothriidae are known\nto infect humans. These pseudophyllidean cestodes have a scolex bearing\nbothria (grooves), instead of suckers as in the cyclophyllidean cestodes (the\ngroup including nearly all human-infecting species). All species associated\nwith human diphyllobothriid infections have marine or aquatic life cycles and\ntransmission occurs via ingestion of undercooked fish.\n\nRecent research incorporating morphologic and molecular data has led to the\nre-classification and re-naming of most of the human-infecting\ndiphyllobothriids. **_Dibothriocephalus latus_** (=_Diphyllobothrium latum_),\nthe “broad fish tapeworm”, is usually assumed to be the most common agent of\nhuman diphyllobothriasis. However, it is possible that many historical cases\nwere falsely attributed to this species. **_Dibothriocephalus nihonkaiense_**\n(_=Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense_)_,**Dibothriocephalus dendriticus**\n_(=_Diphyllobothrium dendriticum_), **_Diphyllobothrium\nstemmacephalum_**(**=**_Diphyllobothrium stemmacephalum; =Diphyllobothrium\nyonagoense_), **_Diphyllobothrium balaenopterae_** (=_Diplogonoporus grandis_\n; _=Diplogonoporus balaenoptera_), and **_Adenocephalus pacificus_**\n_(=Diphyllobothrium pacificum_) are also known to infect humans. Sporadic case\nreports exist involving several other diphyllobothriid species, although some\nof the species identifications in these reports are of questionable validity.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Life\nCycle](/dpdx/diphyllobothriasis/modules/Diphyllobothrid_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=49278)](/dpdx/diphyllobothriasis/modules/Diphyllobothrid_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View\nLarger](/dpdx/diphyllobothriasis/modules/Diphyllobothrid_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nEggs are passed unembryonated in feces\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Under appropriate\nconditions, the eggs mature (approximately 18 to 20 days)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) and yield oncospheres\nwhich develop into a coracidia\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . After ingestion by a\nsuitable crustacean (first intermediate host) the coracidia develop into\nprocercoid larvae ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) .\nProcercoid larvae are released from the crustacean upon predation by the\nsecond intermediate host (usually a small fish) and migrate into the deeper\ntissues where they develop into a plerocercoid larvae (spargana), which is the\ninfectious stage for the definitive host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Because humans do not\ngenerally eat these small fish species raw, the second intermediate host\nprobably does not represent an important source of human infection. However,\nthese small second intermediate hosts can be eaten by larger predator species\nthat then serve as paratenic hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . In this case, the\nplerocercoid migrates to the musculature of the larger predator fish; humans\n(and other definitive host species) acquire the parasite via consumption of\nundercooked paratenic host fish\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . In the definitive host,\nthe plerocercoid develops into adult tapeworms in the small intestine. Adult\ndiphyllobothriids attach to the intestinal mucosa by means of two bilateral\ngroves (bothria) of their scolex\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) . The adults can reach\nmore than 10 m in length, with more than 3,000 proglottids. Immature eggs are\ndischarged from the proglottids (up to 1,000,000 eggs per day per worm) and\nare passed in the feces. Eggs appear in the feces 5 to 6 weeks after\ninfection.\n\n### Hosts\n\nIntermediate and paratenic hosts include a wide diversity of freshwater and\nmarine fishes, commonly perch and pike for **_Dibothriocephalus_**** _latus_**\nand salmon for **_D. nihonkaiense_**.\n\nDefinitive host specificity among the medically important diphyllobothriids is\nlow. In addition to humans, other carnivorous, fish-eating mammals and a few\nbirds can also serve as definitive hosts. Non-human definitive hosts for\n**_D._****_latus_** , **_D._****_nihonkaiense_** , and **_D. dendriticus_**\ninclude a variety of carnivorous mammals (canids, felids, bears, and\nmustelids); of these, only **_D. dendriticus_** is known to parasitize birds,\nparticularly gulls. Pinnipeds are the natural definitive host for\n**_Adenocephalus pacificus_** and it has also been found in dogs and jackals.\nAmong the cetacean-associated species, **_Diphyllobothrium stemmacephalum_**\nis found mostly in dolphins and porpoises, and **_D.__balaenopterae_** in\nwhales.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n**_Dibothriocephalus latus_** has a relatively wide distribution, but is most\ncommon in circumpolar regions; it is also known to occur very rarely in South\nAmerica, perhaps through importation and aquaculture. **_D. nihonkaiense_** is\nendemic to the northern Pacific Ocean and cases are common in East Asian\ncountries where raw fish dishes are popular. **_D. dendriticus_** has a\ngenerally holarctic distribution and is most prevalent in the arctic. While\nfound in hosts across the Pacific Ocean, a large majority of **_Adenocephalus\npacificus_** cases occur on the Pacific coast of South America and one case\nhas occurred in South Australia. **_Diphyllobothrium stemmacephalum_** and\n**_D._****_balaenopterae_** are considered to have a cosmopolitan marine\ndistribution.\n\nNote that the global trade and consumption of wild-caught fish leads to human\ncases occurring regularly outside of naturally endemic regions.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nDiphyllobothriasis can be a long-lasting infection, up to 25 years. Most\ninfections are asymptomatic but gastrointestinal symptoms may occur in some\npatients. Aberrant migration of proglottids can cause cholecystitis or\ncholangitis. Rarely, massive infections may cause intestinal obstruction.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### **Diphyllobothriid** **eggs**\n\nDiphyllobothriid eggs are oval or ellipsoidal and range in size from 55 to 75\nµm by 40 to 50 µm. There is an operculum at one end that can be inconspicuous,\nand at the opposite (abopercular) end is a small knob that can be barely\ndiscernible. The eggs are passed in the stool unembryonated. Although eggs of\n_Adenocephalus pacificus_ are generally smaller than those of\n_Dibothriocephalus_ spp. and _Diphyllobothrium_ spp., there is a degree of\noverlap and thus species identification based on eggs may not be reliable.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/diphyllobothriasis/images/1/Dlatum_eggs_OR.jpg?_=01750)\n\nFigure A: Eggs of diphyllobothriids in an iodine-stained wet mount.

The scolex always has two bothria (grooves).\nThe general size and shape of the scolex may be subject to intraspecific\nvariability, though some species-level differences have been described\nhistorically. Proglottids are broader than long, with a single genital pore\nthat opens in the middle of the ventral surface; fully mature specimens may be\ncomprised of a 2,000—5,000 proglottids. The ovaries are characteristically\nrosette-shaped.\n\n![Figure\nA](/dpdx/diphyllobothriasis/images/3/Dlatum_whole_worm_FL.jpg?_=01760)\n\nFigure A: Section of an adult _Dibothriocephalus latus_ containing many\nproglottids.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs in the stool is the basis of family level\ndiagnosis; genus level identification based on eggs is difficult due to\noverlap in morphological features. Eggs are usually numerous and can be\ndemonstrated without concentration techniques. Identification of proglottids\npassed in the stool is also of diagnostic value.\n\nPCR on DNA extracted from concentrated eggs or proglottids (either fresh or\npreserved with a PCR-compatible fixative) is usually necessary for species-\nlevel identification, as clinical samples usually lack sufficient\nmorphologically-relevant material from adult worms (e.g. scolex, neck,\nstrobila). Also, treatment may distort morphologic features of expelled\ncestodes tissues. Molecular identification is generally only used in research\ncapacities at present.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites.](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool samples apply. Unlike taeniid tapeworm eggs (e.g. _Taenia,\nEchinococcus, Hymenolepis_), diphyllobothriid eggs are not directly infectious\nto humans.\n\n",
