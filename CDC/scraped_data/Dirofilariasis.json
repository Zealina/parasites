  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe genus _Dirofilaria_ includes vector-borne filarial nematodes, which are\nusually associated with carnivore hosts. Some _Dirofilaria_ spp. are zoonotic;\nthe most commonly seen species in human patients are _D. repens_ , _D. tenuis_\n, and _D. immitis_ (the dog heartworm). Rare human infections with other\nspecies such as _D. striata_ and _D. ursi-_ like species (_D. ursi_ or _D.\nsubdermata_) have been reported. Recently, a _D. repens-_ like agent infecting\nhumans was identified in Hong Kong, which has been proposed as a new species\n_D.__hongkongensis_.__ Human dirofilariasis is generally divided into\npulmonary dirofilariasis (_D. immitis_) and subcutaneous dirofilariasis (_D.\nrepens, D. tenuis,_ and others).\n\n[![](/dpdx/dirofilariasis/modules/Diro_Pulmonary_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=87918)](/dpdx/dirofilariasis/modules/Diro_Pulmonary_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/dirofilariasis/modules/Diro_Pulmonary_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nDuring a blood meal, an infected mosquito introduces third-stage filarial\nlarvae of _Dirofilaria immitis_ into the skin of the definitive host, where\nthey penetrate into the bite wound\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . In the definitive host,\nthe L3 larvae undergo two more molts into L4 and adults. Adults reside in\npulmonary arteries, and are occasionally found in the right ventricle of the\nheart ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Adult females are\nusually 230-310 mm long by 350 µm wide; males are usually 120-190 mm long by\n300 µm wide. Adults can live for 5 – 10 years. In the heart, the female worms\nproduce microfilariae which circulate in peripheral blood\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . A mosquito ingests these\nmicrofilariae during a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . After ingestion, the\nmicrofilariae migrate from the mosquito’s midgut through the hemocoel to the\nMalpighian tubules in the abdomen\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . There the microfilariae\ndevelop into first-stage larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) and subsequently into\nthird-stage infective larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . The third-stage\ninfective larvae migrate to the mosquito’s proboscis\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) and can infect another\ndefinitive host when the mosquito takes a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . In humans\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) , _D. immitis_ larvae tend\nto follow the same migratory pathway as in the canine host, ending up in the\nlungs, where they often lodge in small-caliber vessels, causing infarcts and\ntypical “coin lesions” visible on radiographs. Occasionally, _D. immitis_ may\ncause subcutaneous or other ectopic infections.\n\n[![](/dpdx/dirofilariasis/modules/Diro_SQ_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=87921)](/dpdx/dirofilariasis/modules/Diro_SQ_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/dirofilariasis/modules/Diro_SQ_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nVarious _Dirofilaria_ species of the subgenus _Nochtiella_ can cause\nsubcutaneous infections. During a blood meal, an infected mosquito introduces\nthird-stage filarial larvae of _Dirofilaria repens_ or _D. tenuis_ onto the\nskin of the definitive host (canids and sometimes felids for D. repens,\nraccoons for _D. tenuis_), where they penetrate into the bite wound\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . In the definitive host,\nthe L3 larvae undergo two more molts into L4 and adults, the latter of which\nreside in subcutaneous tissues\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . _D. repens_ adult\nfemales are usually 100—170 mm long by 460—650 µm wide; males are usually\n50—70 mm long by 370—450 µm wide. _D. tenuis_ is slightly smaller; adult\nfemales are usually 80-130 mm long by 260—360 µm wide; males are usually 40—50\nmm long by 190—260 µm wide. Females produce microfilariae that are released\ninto the peripheral blood ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg)\n. A mosquito ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . After ingestion, the\nmicrofilariae migrate from the mosquito’s midgut through the hemocoel to the\nMalpighian tubules in the abdomen\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) .

In humans\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) , _D. repens_ usually\nmanifests as either a wandering worm in the subcutaneous tissue or a\ngranulomatous nodule, although there are reports of pulmonary dirofilariasis\nwith this species. _D. tenuis_ follows a similar presentation, but may also be\nfound around the eye or on the conjunctiva. Because of this, the infection in\nhumans was first known as _Dirofilaria conjunctivae_.\n\nSubcutaneous infections with _Dirofilaria striata_ , _D. ursi_ , and possibly\n_D. subdermata_ have been reported. Characteristics visible in clinical\nspecimens have not been sufficient to definitively distinguish _D. ursi_ and\n_D. subdermata_ , so suspected infections are usually reported as “ _D. ursi_\n-like”. These less common species presumably follow a similar life cycle, but\nwith different hosts (see below).\n\n### Hosts\n\nThe most typical hosts for _D. immitis_ are domestic dogs, coyotes, jackals,\nand wolves. Adult worms are occasionally found in others species such as\ndomestic cats, bobcats, ferrets, and foxes. However, microfilaremia is usually\nlow or absent in these aberrant hosts and thus they are not major reservoirs.\nVectors include mosquitoes from several genera (_Aedes_ , _Culex_ ,\n_Anopheles_ , _Mansonia_).\n\n_D. repens_ definitive hosts include primarily wild and domestic canids, and\noccasionally felids. The only known natural definitive host for _D. tenuis_ is\nthe raccoon. Both are by various mosquito vectors from the genera _Aedes_ ,\n_Culex_ , and _Anopheles_.\n\nAmong the rarer causes of subcutaneous dirofilariasis, _D. ursi_ is a parasite\nof bears including American black bears (_Ursus americanus_), grizzly bears\n(_U. arctos_), and Asian black bears (_U. thiabetanus_), and is transmitted by\nblack flies (_Simulium_ spp.)_,_ rather than the mosquito vectors of most\nother _Dirofilaria_ species. The North American porcupine (_Erethizon\ndorsatum_) is the definitive host for _D. subdermata. D. striata_ has been\ndescribed from some wild Nearctic felids (e.g. bobcats, pumas, ocelots).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Dirofilaria immitis_ is cosmopolitan in dogs in North and South America,\nAustralia, Japan and Europe, and is particularly prevalent in warmer areas\nwhere transmission is sustained for most of the year.\n\n_Dirofilaria repens_ is exclusive to the Old World, infecting dogs and cats\nacross Europe, Asia, and Africa. In Europe, the Mediterranean region is\nconsidered highly _D. repens_ -endemic. The European range of _D. repens_\nseems to be expanding, with transmission has been documented as far north as\nFinland and East into European Russia.\n\nAmong species occurring in the New World, the range of _D. tenuis_ is not\nfully characterized, but it is prevalent in raccoons in Florida. _Dirofilaria\nstriata_ is a parasite of wild felids in North, Central, and South America;\nthe only confirmed human infection (subcutaneous) occurred in North Carolina.\n_Dirofilaria ursi_ is mostly a North American species, having been found in\nbears from Canada and the northern United States, but some reports exist from\nJapan.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n_Dirofilaria immitis_ most often causes pulmonary disease in the human host,\nbut can also uncommonly cause nodules in other tissues. Humans are suboptimal\nhosts and larvae that migrate to the heart usually die. Dead worms produce\ninfarcts when they lodge in pulmonary vessels; these infarcts are usually\nreferred to as “coin lesions” on chest radiography, which may be mistaken for\nmalignancy. Following embolization, patients may present with vague systemic\nsymptoms (e.g. malaise, fever, chills) and respiratory distress. There is\noften a mild eosinophilia.\n\nSpecies of _Dirofilaria_ in the subgenus _Nochtiella_ usually (but not always)\nmanifest as subcutaneous nodules. These nodules are often tender, and may be\nfixed or migratory. _D. repens-_ associated lesions can occur in a variety of\nlocations, the most typical being in exposed sites (e.g. scalp, arms, legs,\neyelids, chest), but occasionally have been found in deeper tissue such as the\nbreast, epididymis, spermatic cord, and subconjunctiva. Many reports of _D.\ntenuis_ involve the facial region (e.g. ocular and periocular sites, oral\nmucosa, cheek) and breast nodules. Unlike _D. immitis,_ some of these species\n__ may achieve a degree of development beyond the larval stage in the human\nhost, as adult-stage _D. repens_ and _D. tenuis_ are often discovered in human\ninfections. However, most do not develop to sexual maturity. There are very\nrare reports of patent _D. repens_ infections in humans with detectable\nmicrofilariae in the blood.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### _Dirofilaria_ spp.\n\nThe genus _Dirofilaria_ consists of many species that infect a wide range of\nhosts worldwide, including carnivores, rodents and primates. Humans are\nincidental hosts for several of these; the most frequent include the dog\nparasites _D. immitis_ and _D. repens_ , and the raccoon parasite _D. tenuis_.\nThe worms usually die before completing their development in the human host,\nbut tend to follow the same migratory pathway as in the natural definitive\nhost; _D. tenuis_ and _D. repens_ most often remain in the subcutaneous tissue\nwhere the dying worms produce a localized granulomatous nodule, or, in the\ncase of _D. immitis_ , pulmonary infarcts and/or nodules often appearing as\ncoin lesions on X-ray.\n\n![](/dpdx/dirofilariasis/images/1/Dirofilaria_PA2_answer.jpg?_=01264)\n\nFigure A: Cross-section of _Dirofilaria_ sp. from a subcutaneous nodule,\nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n_Dirofilaria immitis_ is usually diagnosed by the finding of the distinctive\ncoin lesions on chest X-rays. The species that produce subcutaneous nodules\nare diagnosed by the finding of adult worms in biopsy specimens of these\nnodules. The morphologic features of the cuticle, musculature, and lateral\nchords are important criteria for identifying _Dirofilaria_. Worms removed\nfrom the eye are usually diagnosed by external features of the cuticle; worms\nmay also be processed by routine histologic methods to study the internal\nstructures. There are currently no serologic or molecular methods available in\nthe United States for diagnosis of human dirofilariasis.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard protocols for the processing and examination of histological\nspecimens apply. No infectious stages of _Dirofilaria_ spp. are encountered in\na clinical diagnostic setting.\n\n",
