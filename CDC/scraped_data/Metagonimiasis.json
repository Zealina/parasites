  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Metagonimus yokogawai_ , a minute intestinal fluke (and the smallest human\nfluke).\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/metagonimiasis/modules/Metagonimus_LifeCycle.gif?_=02167)\n\nAdults release fully embryonated eggs each with a fully-developed miracidium,\nand eggs are passed in the host’s feces ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif).\nAfter ingestion by a suitable snail (first intermediate host), the eggs hatch\nand release miracidia which penetrate the snail’s intestine ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif). Snails\nof the genus _Semisulcospira_ are the most frequent intermediate host for\n_Metagonimus yokogawai_. The miracidia undergo several developmental stages in\nthe snail, i.e. sporocysts ![The number\n2a](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2a.gif), rediae\n![The number\n2b](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2b.gif), and\ncercariae ![The number\n2c](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2c.gif). Many\ncercariae are produced from each redia. The cercariae are released from the\nsnail ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif) and\nencyst as metacercariae in the tissues of a suitable fresh/brackish water fish\n(second intermediate host) ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif). The\ndefinitive host becomes infected by ingesting undercooked or salted fish\ncontaining metacercariae ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_5.gif). After\ningestion, the metacercariae excyst, attach to the mucosa of the small\nintestine ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_6.gif)\nand mature into adults (measuring 1.0 mm to 2.5 mm by 0.4 mm to 0.75 mm) ![The\nnumber\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_7.gif).\nIn addition to humans, fish-eating mammals (e.g., cats and dogs) and birds can\nalso be infected by _M. yokogawai_ ![The number\n8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_8.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nMostly the Far East, as well as Siberia, Manchuria, the Balkan states, Israel,\nand Spain.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe main symptoms are diarrhea and colicky abdominal pain. Migration of the\neggs to extraintestinal sites (heart, brain) can occur, with resulting\nsymptoms.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Metagonimus yokogawai_ , adult fluke.\n\n_Metagonimus yokogawai_ adult flukes are minute intestinal flukes (1-2.5 mm in\nlength) that resemble _Heterophyes heterophyes_. An important distinctive\nfeature is the position of the ventral sucker (genitoacetabulum), which is to\nthe side of the midline and closely associated with the genital pore. Adults\nreside in the small intestine of the definitive host.\n\n![](/dpdx/metagonimiasis/images/1/M_yokogawi_adult_BAM.jpg?_=02178)\n\nFigure A: Adult _M. yokogawai_ , stained with carmine. In this figure, the\nfollowing structures are labeled: oral sucker (OS), pharynx (PH), intestine\n(IN), genitoacetabulum (GA), ovary (OV), the large, paired testes (TE), and\neggs within the uterus (EG).\n\n##### Snail intermediate hosts of _M. yokogawai_.\n\nLike all trematodes, _Metagonimus_ requires a snail as an intermediate host.\nSnails in the genus _Semisulcospira_ are the most common intermediate hosts\nfor _M. yokogawai_.\n\n![](/dpdx/metagonimiasis/images/2/Semisulcospira_Conchology_A.jpg?_=02176)\n\nFigure A: Snail in the genus, _Semisulcospira_.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis is based on the microscopic identification of eggs in the stool.\nHowever, the eggs are indistinguishable from those of _Heterophyes\nheterophyes_ and resemble those of _Clonorchis_ and _Opisthorchis_. Specific\ndiagnosis is based on identification of the adult fluke evacuated after\nantihelminthic therapy, or found at autopsy.\n\n",
