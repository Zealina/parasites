  "parasite_biology": "### Casual Agents\n\nSeveral species of amebae are capable of colonizing the human gastrointestinal\ntract but, in contrast to _Entamoeba histolytica_ , are not considered\npathogenic. The nonpathogenic intestinal amebae include several _Entamoeba_\nspecies (_E. coli, E. hartmanni,_ and _E. polecki_), _Endolimax nana,_ and\n_Iodamoeba buetschlii_(_=I. bütschlii_)_._ _Entamoeba_ species in the _E.\nhistolytica_ species complex are discussed under\n[Amebiasis](/dpdx/amebiasis/index.html).\n\n### Life Cycles\n\n[![Lifecycle](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/modules/Intestinal_amebae_19.jpg?_=18337)](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/modules/Intestinal_amebae_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/modules/Intestinal_amebae_lg.jpg)\n\n_Entamoeba coli_ , _E. hartmanni, E. polecki, Endolimax nana,_ and _Iodamoeba\nbuetschlii_ are generally considered nonpathogenic and reside in the lumen of\nthe large intestine in the human host. Both cysts and trophozoites of these\nspecies are passed in stool and are considered diagnostic\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Cysts are typically\nfound in formed stool, whereas trophozoites are typically found in diarrheal\nstool. Intestinal colonization with nonpathogenic amebae occurs after\ningestion of mature cysts in fecally contaminated food, water, or fomites\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Excystation occurs in\nthe small intestine ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) ; and\ntrophozoites are released, which migrate to the large intestine. The\ntrophozoites multiply by binary fission and produce cysts, and both stages are\npassed in the feces ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) .\nBecause of the protection conferred by their cell walls, the cysts can survive\ndays to weeks in the external environment and are responsible for\ntransmission. Trophozoites passed in the stool are rapidly destroyed once\noutside the body and, if ingested, would not survive exposure to the gastric\nenvironment.\n\n### Hosts\n\nHumans are considered the main host for all of the discussed species except\nfor _Entamoeba polecki,_ which is usually associated with primates and swine.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nThese amebae are found worldwide. Prevalence is highest in areas with\ninadequate sanitation.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nNone of these amebae cause symptomatic disease in humans; colonization is\nnoninvasive. However, the presence of trophozoites or cysts of nonpathogenic\namebae in stool indicates that the person from whom the specimen was collected\nhad fecal exposure.\n\n",

Mature cysts have four small nuclei with large, usually\ncentrally located karyosomes and no peripheral chromatin. The nuclei are not\nvisible in unstained wet mounts but are visible in iodine-stained wet mounts\nand slides stained with trichrome or iron hematoxylin (i.e., permanent\nstains).

The nucleus\nlacks peripheral chromatin. Their cytoplasm is granular and often highly\nvacuolated and may contain inclusions of bacteria.

Mature cysts typically have 8 nuclei but may have as many as\n16 or more. _Entamoeba coli_ is the only _Entamoeba_ species found in humans\nthat has more than four nuclei in the cyst stage. The nuclei may be seen in\nunstained as well as stained specimens. Karyosomes may be compact or diffuse\nand are usually eccentrically located. Peripheral chromatin is present and is\noften coarse, granular, and irregularly arranged along the nuclear membrane\nbut may be more uniform. The cytoplasm of mature cysts may contain diffuse\nglycogen. Chromatoid bodies are seen less frequently than in _E. histolytica_.\nWhen present, they are usually splinter like with pointed ends, whereas the\nchromatoid bodies of _E. histolytica_ have rounded ends.\n\n![](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/4/Ecoli_cyst_wtmt.jpg?_=00461)\n\nFigure A: Cyst of _E. coli_ in a unstained concentrated wet mount.

The trophozoites\nhave a single nucleus with a characteristically large, eccentric karyosome and\ncoarse, irregular peripheral chromatin. The cytoplasm is usually coarsely\ngranular and vacuolated (often described as “dirty” cytoplasm). Pseudopodia\nmay be seen and are often short and blunt; movement in living trophozoites is\nnondirectional.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/6/Ecoli_troph_tric.jpg?_=00440)\n\nFigure A: Trophozoite of _E. coli_ stained with trichrome.\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/6/Ecoli_troph_tric2.jpg?_=00441)\n\nFigure B: Trophozoite of _E. coli_ stained with trichrome.\n\n![Figure C](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/6/Ecoli_troph_tric3.jpg?_=00439)\n\nFigure C: Trophozoites of _E. coli_ stained with trichrome.\n\n![Figure D](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/6/E_coli_troph_BAM1.jpg?_=00438)\n\nFigure D: Trophozoite of _E. coli_ stained with trichrome.\n\n**_Entamoeba hartmanni_**\n\n_**E. hartmanni**_**cyst in a wet mount.**\n\nCysts of _Entamoeba hartmanni_ are similar to those of _E. histolytica_ but\nsmaller, measuring 5–10 µm. Mature cysts contain four nuclei that have a\nsmall, discrete, centrally located karyosome and evenly distributed peripheral\nchromatin. Cysts may not be visible in unstained specimens. The cytoplasm in\nmature cysts may contain diffuse glycogen and may have rounded or elongated\nchromatoid bodies with rounded ends.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/7/Ehartmanni_cyst_wtmt.jpg?_=00476)\n\nFigure A: Cyst of _E. hartmanni_ in a wet mount stained with iodine.\n\n**_E. hartmanni_ cysts stained with trichrome.**\n\n![Figure\nA](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/8/E_hartmanni_cyst_trich_BAM1.jpg?_=00479)\n\nFigure A: Cyst of _E. hartmanni_ stained with trichrome.

The cytoplasm is finely\ngranular.

The nucleus is often large, measuring up to\none-third of the diameter of the cyst. The karyosome is pleomorphic in regards\nto size (small to large), shape (compact to diffuse), and location (central to\neccentric). Peripheral chromatin may range from light to heavy but is usually\nevenly distributed. Cysts also contain an inclusion mass of variable size and\nnumerous chromatoid bodies, which are highly variable in shape and size.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/10/Epolecki_cyst_wtmt.jpg?_=00459)\n\nFigure A: Cyst of _E. polecki_ in a wet mount stained with iodine.

Cysts contain a single nucleus that is not visible\nin either unstained or iodine-stained wet mounts. With permanent stains (such\nas trichrome), the nucleus contains a large, usually eccentrically located\nkaryosome. Achromatic granules may or may not be present around the karyosome.\nAn important diagnostic feature for this species is the presence of a large\ncompact mass (vacuole) of glycogen in the cyst stage. Although this mass can\nbe visible in unstained wet mounts, in iodine-stained preparations it takes on\na darker, reddish-brown color. The glycogen vacuole does not stain with\ntrichrome but is visible as a well-defined mass.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/intestinalamebae/images/13/Iodamoeba_wtmt_BAM4.jpg?_=00446)\n\nFigure A: Cyst of _I. buetschlii_ in an unstained concentrated wet mount.
