  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nThe nematode (roundworm) _Capillaria hepatica_(=_Calodium hepaticum_) causes\nhepatic capillariasis in humans. Nomenclature varies in use globally and by\ndiscipline; _Capillaria hepatica_ is most frequently used in medical\nliterature. _C. hepatica_ is a zoonotic parasite with a low host specificity;\nit primarily exists in rodent and carnivore hosts. Both true and spurious\ninfections occur in humans.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/hepaticcapillariasis/modules/C_hepatica_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=45609)](/dpdx/hepaticcapillariasis/modules/C_hepatica_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/hepaticcapillariasis/modules/C_hepatica_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n_Capillaria hepatica_ has a direct life cycle, with no intermediate host. It\ncan develop with only one definitive host, but likely requires two hosts to\ncomplete the life cycle. Adult worms are located deep within the liver\nparenchyma of the host, and lay hundreds of eggs in the surrounding\nparenchymal tissue ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . The\neggs trapped in the parenchyma can not be passed in the feces of the host, and\nremain in the liver until the animal dies\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) , or more likely, is eaten\nby a predator or scavenger ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg)\n. Eggs ingested by scavengers are unembryonated (not infectious) and are\npassed in through the digestive tract into and out in feces, providing an\nefficient mechanism to release eggs into the environment; this is ecologically\nthe most likely primary route of transmission\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . Eggs embryonate in the\nenvironment ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) , where they\nrequire air and damp soil to become infective. Under natural conditions,\nembryonation is slow and may take between 6 weeks and 5 months. The cycle\ncontinues when embryonated eggs are eaten by a suitable mammalian host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . Infective eggs hatch in\nthe intestine, releasing first stage larvae. The larvae penetrate the\nintestinal wall and migrate via the portal vein to the liver parenchyma within\n3-4 days. Larvae take about 3-4 weeks to mature into adults and mate. Humans\nare usually infected after ingesting embryonated eggs in fecally-contaminated\nfood, water, or soil ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) .\n\nNotably, the presence of _C_. _hepatica_ eggs in human stool during routine\nova-and-parasite (O&P) examinations indicates spurious passage of ingested\neggs, and not a true infection. Diagnosis in humans is usually achieved by\nfinding adults and eggs in biopsy or autopsy specimens.\n\n### Hosts\n\n_C. hepatica_ has a low host specificity, but rodents such as rats are\ngenerally believed to be the most typical host _._ Infections have also been\nidentified in wild and domestic carnivores (e.g. foxes, dogs, cats),\nlagomorphs, swine, primates, and humans.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_C. hepatica_ has a broad global distribution in wildlife. Human cases have\noriginated from all inhabited continents except for Australia, although there\nit exists in wildlife.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nHepatic capillariasis is rare in humans. It typically manifests as an acute or\nsubacute hepatitis with peripheral leukocytosis and eosinophilia,\nhepatomegaly, and persistent fever (which may be as high as 40℃). The\ndeposition of eggs in the liver parenchyma causes granuloma formation and\nliver necrosis, which in heavy infections can lead to potentially fatal liver\ndysfunction. The true incidence in humans may be underestimated due to the\nnonspecific clinical presentation and difficulty of diagnosis.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "_**Capillaria hepatica**_**eggs.**\n\n_Capillaria hepatica_ eggs are 50—70 µm long by 30—35 µm wide. They have a\nstriated shell and shallow polar prominences. Superficially, they may resemble\n_Trichuris_ spp. eggs but are more ellipsoid versus barrel shaped, with smooth\ninstead of protruding poles. Eggs are unembryonated when seen in human feces\n(an indication of a spurious infection). Diagnosis of true infections is\nusually made by finding eggs in biopsy or autopsy specimens.\n\n![](/dpdx/hepaticcapillariasis/images/1/C_hepatica_eggs_200x_HB.jpg?_=96170)\n\nFigure A: Eggs of _C. hepatica_ in liver stained with hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E).\n\n![](/dpdx/hepaticcapillariasis/images/1/C_hepatica_eggs_HE.jpg?_=96172)\n\nFigure D: Eggs of _C. hepatica_ in liver stained with H&E.\n\n![](/dpdx/hepaticcapillariasis/images/1/C_hepatica_tissue_HB.jpg?_=96168)\n\nFigure C: Eggs of _C. hepatica_ in liver stained with H&E.\n\n_**Capillaria hepatica**_**adults.**\n\n_Capillaria hepatica_ adults are slender, delicate nematodes that may reach up\nto 20mm in length and measure only 70—100 µm at the anterior end. However,\nthey are rarely seen intact due to a relatively short life span (40—60 days)\nfrom maturation to death in the parenchyma of the liver.\n\n![](/dpdx/hepaticcapillariasis/images/2/C_hepatica_400x_male_liver.jpg?_=96173)\n\nFigure A: Cross section of a male _C. hepatica_ in liver tissue, stained with\nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\nThe specific diagnosis of _C. hepatica_ infection is based on demonstrating\nthe adult worms and/or eggs in liver tissue at biopsy or necropsy.\nImportantly, the identification of _C. hepatica_ eggs in the stool is a\nspurious finding, which does not result from infection of the human host, but\nfrom ingestion by that host of livers from infected animals.\n\n**More on** : [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions apply for processing [stool\nsamples](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) and\ntissue sections. _C. hepatica_ eggs in stool require time in the environment\nto develop to infectivity and thus fresh stool samples do not represent an\ninfection risk, if samples from spurious infections happened to be examined.\n\n",
