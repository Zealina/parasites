In\nsubcutaneous tissues the larvae ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif) develop\ninto adult filariae, which commonly reside in nodules in subcutaneous\nconnective tissues ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif). Adults\ncan live in the nodules for approximately 15 years. Some nodules may contain\nnumerous male and female worms. Females measure 33 to 50 cm in length and 270\nto 400 µm in diameter, while males measure 19 to 42 mm by 130 to 210 µm. In\nthe subcutaneous nodules, the female worms are capable of producing\nmicrofilariae for approximately 9 years. The microfilariae, measuring 220 to\n360 µm by 5 to 9 µm and unsheathed, have a life span that may reach 2 years.\nThey are occasionally found in peripheral blood, urine, and sputum but are\ntypically found in the skin and in the lymphatics of connective tissues ![The\nnumber 4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif). A\nblackfly ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif). After\ningestion, the microfilariae migrate from the blackfly’s midgut through the\nhemocoel to the thoracic muscles ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_6.gif). There\nthe microfilariae develop into first-stage larvae ![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_7.gif) and\nsubsequently into third-stage infective larvae ![The number\n8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_8.gif). The\nthird-stage infective larvae migrate to the blackfly’s proboscis ![The number\n9](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_9.gif) and can\ninfect another human when the fly takes a blood meal ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe agent of river blindness, _Onchocerca volvulus_ , occurs mainly in Africa,\nwith additional foci in Latin America and the Middle East.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nOnchocerciasis can cause pruritus, dermatitis, onchocercomata (subcutaneous\nnodules), and lymphadenopathies. The most serious manifestation consists of\nocular lesions that can progress to blindness.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### Microfilariae of _Onchocerca volvulus_ in tissue.\n\nMicrofilariae of _Onchocerca volvulus_ are unsheathed and measure 300-315 µm\nin length. The tail tapers to a point and is often sharply bent. The nuclei do\nnot extend to the tip of the tail. Microfilariae typically reside in skin but\nmay be found in blood or urine during heavy infections, or invade the eye and\ncause a condition known as river blindness.\n\n![](/dpdx/onchocerciasis/images/1/O_volvulus_filaria_BAM1.jpg?_=96094)\n\nFigure A: Microfilariae of _O. volvulus_ from a skin nodule of a patient from\nZambia, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\n#### Microscopy\n\nOnchocerciasis is usually diagnosed by the finding of microfilariae in skin\nsnips or adults in biopsy specimens of skin nodules. Microfilariae of\n_Onchocerca_ do not exhibit any form of periodicity and skin snips may be\ncollected at any time.\n\nSkin snips should be thin enough to include the outer part of the dermal\npalpillae but not so thick as to produce bleeding. Skin snips should be placed\nimmediately in normal saline or distilled water, just enough to cover the\nspecimen. Microfilariae tend to emerge more rapidly in saline, however in\neither medium the microfilariae typically emerge in 30-60 min and can be seen\nin wet mount preparations. For a definitive diagnosis, allow the wet mount to\ndry, fix in methanol, and stain with Giemsa or hematoxylin-and-eosin.\n\n",
