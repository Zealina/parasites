The\nmammalian definitive host (cats, dogs, and various fish-eating mammals\nincluding humans) become infected by ingesting undercooked fish containing\nmetacercariae. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum ![The\nnumber\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif)\nand ascend through the ampulla of Vater into the biliary ducts, where they\nattach and develop into adults, which lay eggs after 3 to 4 weeks ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_6.gif).\nThe adult flukes (_O. viverrini_ : 5 mm to 10 mm by 1 mm to 2 mm; _O.\nfelineus_ : 7 mm to 12 mm by 2 mm to 3 mm) reside in the biliary and\npancreatic ducts of the mammalian host, where they attach to the mucosa.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Opisthorchis viverrini_ is found mainly in northeast Thailand, Laos,\nCambodia, and central and southern Vietnam. _Opisthorchis felineus_ is found\nmainly in Italy, Germany, Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMost infections are asymptomatic. Most pathologic manifestations result from\ninflammation and intermittent obstruction of the biliary ducts. In mild cases,\nmanifestations include dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation.\nWith infections of longer duration, the symptoms can be more severe, and\nhepatomegaly and malnutrition may be present. In rare cases, cholangitis,\ncholecystitis, and chlolangiocarcinoma may develop. In addition, infections\ndue to _Opisthorchis felineus_ may present an acute phase resembling Katayama\nfever (schistosomiasis), with fever, facial edema, lymphadenopathy,\narthralgias, rash, and eosinophilia. Chronic forms of _Opisthorchis felineus_\ninfections present the same manifestations as _Opisthorchis viverrini_ , with\nin addition involvement of the pancreatic ducts.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### Eggs of _Opisthorchis_ spp. in wet mounts.\n\nEggs of _Opisthorchis_ spp. are 19-30 µm long by 10-20 µm wide and are often\nindistinguishable from the eggs of _Clonorchis sinensis_. The eggs are\noperculated and possess prominent opercular ‘shoulders’ and and abopercular\nknob. The eggs are embryonated when passed in feces.\n\n![](/dpdx/opisthorchiasis/images/1/O_viverrini_egg_wtmt_BAM1.jpg?_=00774)\n\nFigure A: Egg of _O. viverrini_ in an unstained wet mount of concentrated\nstool.

Image taken at 400x magnification.\n\n##### Adults of _Opisthorchis_ spp.\n\nAdults of _Opisthorchis_ spp. are similar to, but often smaller than,\n_Clonorchis sinensis_. Adults measure approximately 7 mm long by 1.5 mm wide\nin the human host (adults are slightly smaller in feline hosts). Adults of\n_Opisthorchis_ spp. differ from adults of _Clonorchis_ in the shape of the\ntestes. The distribution of the vitelline glands is also different. Both\ngenera are similar, however, in having a ventral sucker (acetabulum) smaller\nthan the oral sucker. Adults reside in the bile ducts of the definitive host.\n\n![](/dpdx/opisthorchiasis/images/2/O_felineus_Korea.jpg?_=00769)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _O. felineus_.

Snails in the genera _Bithynia_ and _Cordiella_ may serve as a first\nintermediate host for _Opisthorchis_ spp.\n\n![](/dpdx/opisthorchiasis/images/3/Bithynia_tentaculata_Manas.jpg?_=00771)\n\nFigure A: _Bithynia_ sp., a common intermediate host of _Opisthorchis_ spp.\nImage courtesy of Michal Maňas.\n\n",
  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is based on microscopic identification of eggs in stool specimens.\nHowever, the eggs of _Opisthorchis_ are practically indistinguishable from\nthose of _Clonorchis_. The adult fluke can also be recovered at surgery.\n\nSerologic testing is currently not available for _Opisthorchis_ infection in\nthe United States.\n\n**More on:** [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n",
