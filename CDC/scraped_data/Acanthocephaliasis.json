  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nAcanthocephala (also known as spiny- or thorny-headed worms) are common\nparasites of wildlife and some domestic animal species, but they rarely infect\nhumans. Species recovered from humans include _Macracanthorynchus\nhirudinaceus, Macracanthorynchus ingens_ , _Moniliformis moniliformis,\nAcanthocephalus rauschi, Pseudoacanthocephalus bufonis, Corynosoma strumosum,_\nand _Bolbosoma_ sp. _M. hirudinaceus_ and _M. moniliformis_ are the most\ncommon species implicated in human infections.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Lifecycle\nimage](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/modules/Acanthocephala_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=16374)](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/modules/Acanthocephala_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View\nLarger](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/modules/Acanthocephala_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nEggs are shed in the feces of the definitive hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . The eggs contain a fully\ndeveloped acanthor when shed in feces. The eggs are ingested by an\nintermediate host ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) , which\nis always an insect. Within the hemocoelom of the insect, the acanthor\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2a.jpg) molts into a second\nlarval stage, called an acanthella\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2b.jpg) . After 6–12 weeks, the\nworm reaches the infective stage called a cystacanth\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2c.jpg) . The definitive host\nbecomes infected upon ingestion of intermediate hosts containing infective\ncystacanths ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . In the\ndefinitive host, liberated juveniles attach to the wall of the small\nintestine, where they mature\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) and mate in about 8–12\nweeks. In humans ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) the worms\nseldom develop to full maturity or produce eggs.\n\n### Hosts\n\nNatural definitive hosts include rats (_Moniliformis moniliformis_), swine\n(_Macracanthorynchus hirudinaceus_), and raccoons (_Macracanthorynchus\ningens_). The insect intermediate host varies by species but is usually\nscarabaeoid or hydrophilid beetles for _M. hirudinaceus_ and likely _M.\ningens,_ and beetles or cockroaches for _M. moniliformis_.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nAcanthocephala are widely distributed. Cases of acanthocephaliasis more\ncommonly occur in areas where insects are eaten for dietary or medicinal\npurposes or in children who consume insects. _Macracanthorynchus hirudinaceus_\nis found wherever wild or domestic swine occur. _Macracanthorynchus ingens_ is\nhighly endemic in raccoons from the southeastern United States, and the\nrecorded human cases originate from Texas and Florida. The distribution of\n_Moniliformis moniliformis_ is not known but is likely cosmopolitan.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nClinical symptoms of acanthocephaliasis are often severe, due in part to the\nmechanical damage caused by the insertion of the armed proboscis into the\nlumen of the host’s intestine. Symptoms generally include abdominal pain and\nrelated digestive complaints. However, low-intensity or early infections may\nbe asymptomatic.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### **Eggs of _Macracanthorhynchus_ sp.**\n\n_Macracanthorhynchus_ sp. eggs are 80–100 µm long by 50 µm wide. They are\novoid and have a thick, dark brown shell that is textured. Eggs are shed in\nfeces and contain a larva (acanthor) that possesses rostellar hooks. When\nadults do reach maturity in the human host, they rarely produce eggs, so eggs\nare not usually found in the feces of infected humans.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/1/M_hirudinaceous_egg1.jpg?_=05020)\n\nFigure A: Eggs of _M. hirudinaceous_ in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/1/M_hirudinaceous_egg2.jpg?_=05022)\n\nFigure B: Egg of _M. hirudinaceous_ in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/1/M_hirudinaceous_egg3.jpg?_=05024)\n\nFigure C: Image of the same egg in Figure B but in a different plane of focus,\nshowing the textured exterior.\n\n##### **Eggs of _Moniliformis moniliformis._**\n\n_Moniliformis moniliformis_ eggs are 90–125 µm long by 65 µm wide. They are\nelongate-oval and have a thick, clear shell. Eggs are shed in feces and\ncontain a larva (acanthor) that possesses rostellar hooks. The normal\ndefinitive hosts for  _M. moniliformis_ are rodents, including rats. Adults\nseldom mature in the human host. When adults do reach maturity in the human\nhost, they rarely produce eggs, so eggs are not usually found in the feces of\ninfected humans.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/2/M_moniliformis_egg_HB1.jpg?_=05047)\n\nFigure A: Eggs of _M. moniliformis_ liberated from an adult worm that was\nrecovered from the stool of a patient.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/2/M_moniliformis_egg_HB2.jpg?_=05049)\n\nFigure B: Egg of _M. moniliformis_ liberated from an adult worm that was\nrecovered from the stool of a patient.\n\n##### **Adults of**** _Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus._**\n\nAdults of  _Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus_ are large pseudocoelomates that\nvary in color from milky-white to pinkish to reddish. The body typically has a\nwrinkled appearance, giving the illusion of segmentation (pseudosegmentation).\nAdult females measure 18–65 cm long by 4–10 mm wide; adult males measure 5–10\ncm long by 3–5 mm wide. The proboscis contains 5 or 6 rows of recurved hooks.\nAdults reside in the intestine of the definitive host, which is usually a pig.\nIn humans, the worms seldom mature and when they do, rarely produce eggs.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/3/M_hirudinaceous_adult_BAM1.jpg?_=05038)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _M. hirudinaceous_.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/3/M_hirudinaceous_anterior_BAM1.jpg?_=05036)\n\nFigure B: Higher magnification of the specimen in Figure A, showing a close-up\nof the anterior end and the proboscis containing hooks.\n\n##### **Adults of _Moniliformis moniliformis_.**\n\nAdults of  _Moniliformis moniliformis_ are large pseudocoelomates that are\npseudosegmented and chalky-white in color. Adult females measure 10−30 cm long\nby 1.25–1.5 mm wide; adult males measure 4–10 cm long. The cylindrical\nproboscis contains 12–15 spiral rows of recurved hooks. Adults reside in the\nintestine of the definitive hosts, which are usually rodents.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/4/M_moniliformis_adult_HB1.jpg?_=05034)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _M. moniliformis_.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/4/M_moniliformis_adult_HB2.jpg?_=05032)\n\nFigure B: Adult of _M. moniliformis_.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/4/M_moniliformis_anterior_HB1.jpg?_=05031)\n\nFigure C: Higher magnification of the anterior end of the specimen in Figures\nA and B, showing a close-up of the proboscis.\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/4/M_moniliformis_anterior_HB2.jpg?_=05029)\n\nFigure D: Higher magnification of the anterior end of the specimen in Figures\nA and B, showing a close-up of the proboscis.\n\n##### **Acanthocephalans in tissue, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H\n&E).**\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/5/Bolbosoma_HE_100x_BAM1.jpg?_=05044)\n\nFigure A: Transverse section through the body wall of _Bolbosoma_ sp. in an\nintestinal biopsy specimen, stained with H&E.

The intermediate host for\n_Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus_ is usually a scarabaeoid or hydrophilid\nbeetle; _M. ingens_ is known to use woodroaches. The intermediate host for\n_Moniliformis moniliformis_ is usually a cockroach or beetle. The intermediate\nhosts for  _Bolbosoma_ spp. are microcrustacea, with fish serving as paratenic\nhosts. Humans usually become infected with acanthocephalans by ingesting\ninfected intermediate or paratenic hosts.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/6/melolonthine_PADIL.jpg?_=05027)\n\nFigure A: Larva of a melolonthine scarab beetle, also known as a \"white grub\".\nWhite grubs and dung beetle larvae are the most common intermediate hosts for\n_M. hirudinaceus._ Image courtesy of Parasite and Diseases Image Library,\nAustralia (http://www.padil.gov.au/).\n\n![](/dpdx/acanthocephaliasis/images/6/P_americana_PADIL.jpg?_=05025)\n\nFigure B: American cockroach, _Periplaneta americana_.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is made by the observation of eggs or adults in stool. As humans are\nnot the usual definitive host for acanthocephalans, the parasites often do not\nreach sexual maturity and produce eggs. Eggs in feces, especially in the\nabsence of other symptoms, may indicate spurious passage.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard laboratory safety protocols apply. Acanthocephalan eggs are not\ninfectious to humans.\n\n",
