  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe coccidian parasite, _Cystoisospora belli_ , infects the epithelial cells\nof the small intestine, and is the least common of the three intestinal\ncoccidia that infect humans.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/modules/Cystoisospora_LifeCycle.gif?_=05595)\n\nAt time of excretion, the immature oocyst contains usually one sporoblast\n(more rarely two)![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif).\nIn further maturation after excretion, the sporoblast divides in two (the\noocyst now contains two sporoblasts); the sporoblasts secrete a cyst wall,\nthus becoming sporocysts; and the sporocysts divide twice to produce four\nsporozoites each![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_2.gif).\nInfection occurs by ingestion of sporocysts-containing oocysts: the sporocysts\nexcyst in the small intestine and release their sporozoites, which invade the\nepithelial cells and initiate schizogony![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_3.gif).\nUpon rupture of the schizonts, the merozoites are released, invade new\nepithelial cells, and continue the cycle of asexual multiplication![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_4.gif).\nTrophozoites develop into schizonts which contain multiple merozoites. After a\nminimum of one week, the sexual stage begins with the development of male and\nfemale gametocytes![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif).\nFertilization results in the development of oocysts that are excreted in the\nstool![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. Infection occurs in\nimmunodepressed individuals, and outbreaks have been reported in\ninstitutionalized groups in the United States.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nInfection causes acute, nonbloody diarrhea with crampy abdominal pain, which\ncan last for weeks and result in malabsorption and weight loss. In\nimmunodepressed patients, and in infants and children, the diarrhea can be\nsevere. Eosinophilia may be present (differently from other protozoan\ninfections).\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Cystoisospora belli_ oocysts.\n\nThe oocysts of _C. belli_ are large (25 to 30 µm) and have a typical\nellipsoidal shape. When excreted, they are immature and contain one\nsporoblast. The oocyst matures after excretion: the single sporoblast divides\nin two sporoblasts, which develop cyst walls, becoming sporocysts, which\neventually contain four sporozoites each. _Cystoisospora_ will autofluoresce\nunder ultraviolet (UV) microscopy.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/1/C_belli_spore_wtmt1.jpg?_=05586)\n\nFigure A: Immature oocyst of C. belli stained with safranin, containing a\nsingle sporoblast.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/1/C_belli_oocyst_safranin.jpg?_=05588)\n\nFigure B: Immature oocyst of _C. belli_ stained with safranin, containing a\nsingle sporoblast.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/1/C_belli_oocyst_acidfast.jpg?_=05584)\n\nFigure C: Immature oocyst of _C. belli_ stained with acid-fast, showing a\nsingle sporoblast.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/1/C_belli_oocyst_UV_IN.jpg?_=05590)\n\nFigure D: Oocyst of _C. belli_ viewed under ultraviolet (UV) microscopy,\nshowing two sporoblasts.\n\n_Cystoisospora belli_ oocysts.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/2/C_belli_oocyst_wtmt2_40x.jpg?_=05572)\n\nFigure A: Immature oocyst of _C. belli_ in an unstained wet mount showing a\nsingle sporoblast.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/2/C_belli_oocyst_wtmt_uv2_40x.jpg?_=05575)\n\nFigure E: Same oocyst as in Figures A and C but viewed under ultraviolet (UV)\nfluorescent micrscopy.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/2/C_belli_oocyst_wtmt_40x.jpg?_=05579)\n\nFigure B: Immature oocyst of _C. belli_ in an unstained wet mount showing two\nsporoblasts.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/2/C_belli_oocyst_wtmt_uv_40x.jpg?_=05573)\n\nFigure F: Same oocyst as in Figures B and D but viewed under UV microscopy.\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/2/C_belli_oocyst_wtmt_DIC2_40x.jpg?_=05577)\n\nFigure C: Same oocyst as in Figure A but viewed under differential\ninterference contrast (DIC).\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/2/C_belli_oocyst_wtmt_DIC_40x.jpg?_=05570)\n\nFigure D: Same oocyst as in Figure B but viewed under ultraviolet (UV)\nfluorescent micrscopy.\n\n_Cystoisospora belli_ oocysts, stained with hematoxylin and eoisin (H&E).\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/3/Cystoisospora_HE_1.jpg?_=05581)\n\nFigure A: Oocyst of _C. belli_ in the epithelial cells of a mammalian host,\nstained with H&E (yellow arrow).\n\n![](/dpdx/cystoisosporiasis/images/3/Cystoisospora_HnE_3.jpg?_=05583)\n\nFigure B: Oocyst of _C. belli_ in the epithelial cells of a mammalian host,\nstained with H&E (yellow arrow).\n\n",
  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic demonstration of the large, typically shaped oocysts, is the basis\nfor diagnosis. Because the oocysts may be passed in small amounts and\nintermittently, repeated stool examinations and concentration procedures are\nrecommended. If stool examinations are negative, examination of duodenal\nspecimens by biopsy or string test (Enterotest®) may be needed. The oocysts\ncan be visualized on wet mounts by microscopy with bright-field, differential\ninterference contrast (DIC), and epifluorescence. They can also be stained by\nmodified acid-fast stain.\n\n#### Morphology\n\nMore on: [Morphological comparisons with other intestinal\nparasites.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n#### Bench Aids\n\n[![A thumbnail for the linked\ndocument.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/cystoisospora_benchaid.jpg)Key\npoints for laboratory diagnosis of cystoisosporiasis — _Cystoisospora belli_\n![Adobe PDF file](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/images/icon_pdf.gif)\n[PDF, 204 KB, 2\nPages]](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/cystoisospora_benchaid.pdf)\n\n[![A thumbnail for the linked\ndocument.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/coccidia_benchaid.jpg)Key\npoints for laboratory diagnosis of _Cyclospora, Cryptosporidium_ and\n_Cystroisospora belli_ ![Adobe PDF\nfile](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/images/icon_pdf.gif) [PDF, 157 KB, 1\nPage]](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/coccidia_benchaid.pdf)\n\n",
