  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Cyclospora cayetanensis_ is a coccidian protozoan. It appears that all human\ncases are caused by this species; no animal reservoirs for _C. cayetanensis_\nhave been identified.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/cyclosporiasis/modules/Cyclosporiasis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=03958)](/dpdx/cyclosporiasis/modules/Cyclosporiasis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/cyclosporiasis/modules/Cyclosporiasis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nWhen freshly passed in stools, the oocyst is not infective\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) (thus, direct fecal-oral\ntransmission cannot occur; this differentiates _Cyclospora_ from another\nimportant coccidian parasite, _Cryptosporidium_). In the environment\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) , sporulation occurs after\ndays or weeks at temperatures between 22°C to 32°C, resulting in division of\nthe sporont into two sporocysts, each containing two elongate sporozoites\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The sporulated oocysts\ncan contaminate fresh produce and water\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) which are then ingested\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . The oocysts excyst in\nthe gastrointestinal tract, freeing the sporozoites, which invade the\nepithelial cells of the small intestine\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . Inside the cells they\nundergo asexual multiplication into type I and type II meronts. Merozoites\nfrom type I meronts likely remain in the asexual cycle, while merozoites from\ntype II meronts undergo sexual development into macrogametocytes and\nmicrogametocytes upon invasion of another host cell. Fertilization occurs, and\nthe zygote develops to an oocyst which is released from the host cell and shed\nin the stool ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . Several\naspects of intracellular replication and development are still unknown, and\nthe potential mechanisms of contamination of food and water are still under\ninvestigation.\n\n### Hosts\n\nHumans appear to be the only major host for _C. cayetanensis._ Occasionally,\ncysts are recovered from animal feces, but it is likely that this represents\nspurious passage following coprophagy.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nCyclosporiasis has been reported in many countries, but is most common in\ntropical and subtropical areas. In the United States, the majority of cases\nare reported during the spring and summer months. Outbreaks have been\nidentified nearly every year since the mid-1990s.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nAfter an average incubation period of one week, symptomatic infections\ntypically manifest as watery diarrhea of varying severity. Other\nmanifestations include complications of dysentery, further abdominal symptoms,\nand sometimes non-specific systemic symptoms (e.g. headache, low-grade fever).\nUntreated infections typically last for 10–12 weeks and may follow a relapsing\ncourse. The duration of symptoms and associated weight loss are greater in\nindividuals with HIV or possibly other immunosuppressive conditions.\nInfections can be asymptomatic in disease-endemic regions.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nUnpreserved stool collected in enteric transport media (e.g., Cary-Blair) is\ncommonly used for culture independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) and can be used\nfor confirmatory testing by microscopy and/or PCR if needed. Unpreserved\nspecimens should be refrigerated and sent to the diagnostic laboratory as\nrapidly as possible.\n\n_Cyclospora_ oocysts can be excreted intermittently and in small numbers.\nThus:\n\n  * A single negative stool specimen does not rule out the diagnosis; three or more specimens at 2- or 3-day intervals may be required.\n  * Concentration procedures should be used to maximize recovery of oocysts. The method most familiar to laboratorians is the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation technique (centrifuge for 10 minutes at 500 × g). Other methods can also be used (such as the Sheather’s flotation procedure).\n\n### Microscopic Examination\n\nThe sediment can be examined microscopically with the following techniques:\n\n  * [Wet mounts](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/microexam.html#wetmount) (by conventional light microscopy, which can be enhanced by [UV fluorescence microscopy](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/microexam.html#UV) or differential interference contrast [[DIC, Nomarsky](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/microexam.html#UV)])\n  * [Stained smears](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/staining.html) (using [modified acid-fast stain](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/staining.html#Acid-Fast) or a [modified safranin stain](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/staining.html#ModSafranin)). Both modified acid-fast stains and modified safranin staining will stain _Cyclospora_ cysts from a pink to brilliant red. Staining may be more variable using modified acid-fast.\n  * Other common stains including Giemsa and trichrome are not adequate for the reliable detection of _Cyclospora_.\n\n### Molecular Diagnosis\n\nSeveral conventional and real-time PCR protocols have been developed to\nspecifically detect _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ in stool. Commercial, FDA-\napproved panels (that include other enteric pathogens) are available and are\nhighly sensitive.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool samples apply.\n\n_Cyclospora_ oocysts are not immediately infectious when passed, however,\nprecautions should still be taken to avoid exposure to other pathogens that\nmay be present in stools.\n\n[Key points for laboratory diagnosis of _Cyclospora_ , _Cryptosporidium_ , and\n_Cystoisospora belli_ ![Adobe PDF\nfile](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/images/icon_pdf.gif) [PDF, 157 KB, 1\nPage]](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/coccidia_benchaid.pdf)\n\n",
