  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\n_Baylisascaris procyonis,_ the raccoon roundworm, is a rare but serious cause\nof neurologic and ocular disease in humans. Only larval stages are involved in\nzoonotic infections. It is not known whether other _Baylisascaris_ species,\nsuch as _B. columnaris_ of skunks, can cause baylisascariasis in humans.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/baylisascariasis/modules/Baylisascaris_lifecycle_19.jpg?_=00758)](/dpdx/baylisascariasis/modules/Baylisascaris_lifecycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/baylisascariasis/modules/Baylisascaris_lifecycle_lg.jpg)\n\n_Baylisascaris procyonis_ completes its life cycle in raccoons, with humans\nacquiring the infection as accidental hosts (dogs serve as alternate\ndefinitive hosts, as they can harbor adult worms and shed eggs). Unembryonated\neggs are shed in the environment\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) , where they take 2–4\nweeks to embryonate and become infective\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Raccoons can be infected\nby ingesting embryonated eggs from the environment\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . Many mammals and birds\ncan act as paratenic hosts ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg)\nfor this parasite: eggs ingested by these hosts hatch and larvae penetrate the\ngut wall and migrate into various tissues where they encyst\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . The life cycle is\ncompleted when raccoons eat these hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . The larvae develop into\nadult worms in the raccoon’s small intestine\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) and eggs are passed in\nraccoon feces. Humans become accidentally infected when they ingest infective\neggs from the environment ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg)\n. Migration of the larvae through a wide variety of tissues (liver, heart,\nlungs, brain, eyes) results in visceral (VLM) and ocular larva migrans (OLM)\nsyndromes, but severe neurologic disease with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis\nmay occur following neural larva migrans (NLM)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) . _B. procyonis_ larvae\ncontinue to increase in size up to about 1.8 mm in human hosts, but they are\nnot capable of migrating to the intestine and developing to adulthood. Tissue\ndamage and the signs and symptoms of baylisascariasis are often severe because\nof the larger size of _B. procyonis_ larvae and their more invasive course of\nmigration.\n\n### Hosts\n\nRaccoons are the major definitive host for _B. procyonis._ Rarely, domestic\ndogs and possibly other procyonids (e.g., kinkajous) may have patent\ninfections and shed eggs in feces. The range of paratenic hosts that are\nsusceptible to larva migrans is broad; infections have been recorded in over\n150 species of birds and mammals.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Baylisascaris procyonis_ is widespread among raccoons in the United States\nand Canada but prevalence varies regionally. Prevalence in raccoons is\nextremely high in the Northeast, Midwest, and on the West Coast, sometimes in\nexcess of 80%. This roundworm has also been found in raccoons in the Southeast\nand Southwest regions where it was historically absent, although the\nprevalence is generally much lower than in northern latitudes. _B. procyonis_\nhas also been introduced to many parts of Europe, China, and Japan through\ntrade of live raccoons. Most documented human cases have occurred in areas\nwhere the parasite is common (e.g., California, Washington, Minnesota, New\nYork).\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nInfection with _Baylisascaris_ larvae can result in larva migrans syndromes,\nincluding visceral larva migrans (VLM), ocular larva migrans (OLM), and neural\nlarva migrans (NLM). _B. procyonis_ -associated NLM is potentially life-\nthreatening. The usual presentation of cerebral baylisascariasis is\neosinophilic meningoencephalitis with typical neurologic signs/symptoms.\nOcular baylisascariasis has been associated with diffuse unilateral subacute\nneuroretinitis (DUSN) potentially leading to permanent vision loss.\n\nSome _Baylisascaris_ infections appear to be subclinical or asymptomatic.\nAntibodies to _Baylisascaris_ have been detected in otherwise healthy\nindividuals, suggesting past infection. The broad-scale prevalence and\nclinical significance of subclinical infections are not well understood.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### _Baylisascaris procyonis_ eggs.\n\n_Baylisascaris procyonis_ eggs are 80—85 µm by 65—70 µm in size, thick-\nshelled, and usually slightly oval in shape. They have a similar morphology to\nfertile eggs of _Ascaris lumbricoides_ , although eggs of _A. lumbricoides_\nare smaller (55—75 µm by 35—50 µm) and more coarsely pitted.__ As humans are\nnot definitive hosts for _B. procyonis,_ eggs are not excreted in human feces.\nThe following images show larval development within the eggs, from a freshly-\nshed unembryonated egg to eggs containing L1 larvae.

Flattening tissue into a\nthin layer between glass plates can be a useful way of visualizing migrating\nlarvae in infected paratenic hosts. Note the inflammatory tracts around the\nlarvae.\n\n##### _B. procyonis_ adults.\n\n_Baylisascaris procyonis_ adults are found only in the definitive host, the\nraccoon (rarely dogs). They have the typical large and robust form of ascarid\nworms, and lack the prominent cervical alae of adult _Toxocara_ species. Males\nmeasure 6—9 cm in length and demonstrate the curved posterior end similar to\n_Ascaris_. Females are very large and measure 8—18 cm in length.\n\n![](/dpdx/baylisascariasis/images/5/Baylisascaris_GA1adults.jpg?_=04684)\n\nFigure A: Several adults of _B. procyonis_ from a raccoon\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/baylisascariasis/images/5/Adult_Bp_B.jpg?_=68236)\n\nFigure B: Large adult female _B. procyonis_ from a naturally infected raccoon.\n\n",
  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nHuman infections are difficult to diagnose, and often the diagnosis is by\nexclusion of other causes. Results from complete blood count (CBC) and\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination often reveal eosinophilia. Examination\nof tissue biopsies can be extremely helpful if a section of larva is\ncontained, but removing a piece of tissue in which there are larva present can\nbe problematic. Ocular examinations revealing a migrating larva, larval\ntracks, or lesions consistent with a nematode larva are often the most\nsignificant clue to infection with _Baylisascaris_.\n\nCDC has developed an immunoblot for detection of antibodies to recombinant\n_Baylisascaris_ antigen (rBpRAG-1) in serum or CSF, which can be performed for\ncases of clinical neurologic disease when the index of suspicion is high*.\n\n* Rascoe, L.N., Santamaria, C., Handali, S., Dangoudoubiyam, S., Kazacos, K.R., Wilkins, P.P. and Ndao, M., 2013.
