  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nCestodes in the genus _Spirometra_ , including _S. mansoni, S. ranarum, S.\nmansonoides and S. erinacei_ , as well as the aberrant _Sparganum proliferum_.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/sparganosis/modules/Sparganosis_LifeCycle.gif?_=00551)\n\nAdult members of the genus _Spirometra_ live in the intestines of dogs and\ncats ![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_7.gif).\nEggs are shed in feces ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif)\nand embryonate in the environment ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif). Eggs\nhatch in water and release coracidia ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif), which\nare ingested by copepods. The coracidia develop into procercoid larvae in the\ncopepod intermediate host ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif). Second\nintermediate hosts, including fish, reptiles and amphibians, ingest infected\ncopepods and acquire procercoid larvae. The procercoid larvae develop into\nplerocercoid larvae in the second intermediate host ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif). The\ncycle is completed when a predator (dog or cat) eats an infected second\nintermediate host ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_6.gif). Humans\ncannot serve as definitive hosts for _Spirometra_ spp., but serve as paratenic\nor second intermediate hosts ![The number\n8.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_8.gif) and\ndevelop sparganosis. Humans acquire sparganosis by either drinking water\ncontaminated with infected copepods or consuming the flesh of an under-cooked\nsecond intermediate or paratenic host. Spargana can live up to 20 years in the\nhuman host.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe genus _Spirometra_ occurs worldwide in distribution, although most human\ncases of sparganosis are recorded from southeast Asian countries. Sparganosis\nis endemic in animals throughout North America, although human cases from this\narea are rare.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMigrating spargana cause various symptoms depending on the final location in\nthe host. Spargana may locate anywhere, including subcutaneous tissue, breast,\norbit, urinary tract, pleural cavity, lungs, abdominal viscera and the central\nnervous system. The migration in subcutaneous tissues is usually painless, but\nwhen spargana settle in the brain or spine a variety of neurological symptoms\nmay occur, including weakness, headache, seizure, and abnormal skin\nsensations, such as numbness or tingling. If the inner ear is involved, the\npatient may experience vertigo or deafness. Occasionally, _Sparganum\nproliferum_ can cause proliferative lesions in the infected tissue, with\nmultiple plerocercoids present in a single site.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is usually made by the recovery of a sparganum from infected tissue.\nThe presence of a sparganum is diagnostic and identification to the species\nlevel is usually not warranted. However, the best way to identify the species\nis to infect an appropriate definitive host with a living sparganum and\nidentify the adult after maturation.\n\n",
