  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nDracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) is caused by the nematode (roundworm)\n_Dracunculus medinensis_.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifecycle](/parasites/images/guineaworm/Dracunculiasis_LifeCycle_3.jpg)\n\nHumans become infected by drinking unfiltered water containing copepods (small\ncrustaceans) which are infected with larvae of _D. medinensis_![The Number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_1.gif).\nFollowing ingestion, the copepods die and release the larvae, which penetrate\nthe host stomach and intestinal wall and enter the abdominal cavity and\nretroperitoneal space![The Number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif). After\nmaturation into adults and copulation, the male worms die and the females\n(length: 70 to 120 cm) migrate in the subcutaneous tissues towards the skin\nsurface![The Number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif).\nApproximately one year after infection, the female worm induces a blister on\nthe skin, generally on the distal lower extremity, which ruptures. When this\nlesion comes into contact with water, a contact that the patient seeks to\nrelieve the local discomfort, the female worm emerges and releases larvae![The\nNumber 4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif).\nThe larvae are ingested by a copepod![The Number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif) and after\ntwo weeks (and two molts) have developed into infective larvae![The Number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_6.gif).\nIngestion of the copepods closes the cycle![The Number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_1.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nAn ongoing eradication campaign has dramatically reduced the incidence of\ndracunculiasis, which is now restricted to rural, isolated areas in a narrow\nbelt of African countries.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe clinical manifestations are localized but incapacitating. The worm emerges\nas a whitish filament (duration of emergence: 1 to 3 weeks) in the center of a\npainful ulcer, accompanied by inflammation and frequently by secondary\nbacterial infection.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nThe clinical presentation of dracunculiasis is so typical, and well known to\nthe local population, that it does not need laboratory confirmation. In\naddition, the disease occurs in areas where such confirmation is unlikely to\nbe available. Examination of the fluid discharged by the worm can show\nrhabditiform larvae. No serologic test is available.\n\n",
