  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\n_Dipylidium caninum_ is a common tapeworm of dogs and cats, but is\noccasionally found in humans. It has many common names including the “flea\ntapeworm”, “cucumber tapeworm”, and “double-pored tapeworm”.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/dipylidium/modules/Dipylidium_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=12731)](/dpdx/dipylidium/modules/Dipylidium_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/dipylidium/modules/Dipylidium_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nGravid proglottids are passed intact in the feces or emerge from the perianal\nregion of the host ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . In\nthe environment, the proglottids disintegrate and release egg packets, which\nare also occasionally found free in the feces\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . The intermediate host\n(most often larval stages of the dog or cat flea _Ctenocephalides_ spp.)\ningests egg packets, and the oncosphere within is released into the larval\nflea’s intestine. The oncosphere penetrates the intestinal wall, invades the\ninsect’s hemocoel (body cavity), and develops into a cysticercoid\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The cysticercoid remains\nin the flea as it matures from a larva into an adult\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The vertebrate host\nbecomes infected by ingesting the adult flea containing the cysticercoid\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . In the small intestine\nof the vertebrate host, the cysticercoid develops into the adult tapeworm\nafter about one month. The adult tapeworms (measuring up to 60 cm in length\nand 3 mm in width) reside in the small intestine of the host, where they each\nattach by their scolex ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) .\nGravid, double-pored proglottids detach from the strobila (body) and are shed\nin the feces.\n\nHumans also acquire infection by ingesting the cysticercoid contaminated flea.\nChildren are most frequently infected, possibly due to close contact with\nflea-infested pets ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\nCanids and felids are the normal hosts for _Dipylidium caninum._ The\nintermediate host is usually the larval stages of the dog or cat flea\n(_Ctenocephalides_ spp.) and occasionally _Trichodectes canis_(the dog louse).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide; this tapeworm is ubiquitous and common among pet dogs and cats.\nHuman infection is rare, but has been reported from every inhabited continent.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMost infections with _Dipylidium caninum_ are asymptomatic. Pets may exhibit\nbehavior to relieve anal pruritis (such as scraping anal region across grass\nor carpeting). Mild gastrointestinal disturbances may occur. The most striking\nfeature in animals and children consists of the passage of proglottids. These\ncan be found in the perianal region, in the feces, on diapers, and\noccasionally on floor covering and furniture. The proglottids are motile when\nfreshly passed and may be mistaken for maggots or fly larvae.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\nThe diagnosis is made by demonstrating the typical proglottids or egg packets\nin the stool or the environment. Although concentration methods are usually\nnot necessary due to the large size of the proglottids, flotation methods may\nmiss infections as egg packets are heavy and may fail to float.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool samples. _D. caninum_ eggs are not infectious to humans.\n\n",
