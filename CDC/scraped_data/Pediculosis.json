  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nPediculosis is infestation with the human head-and-body louse, _Pediculus\nhumanus_. There are two subspecies, the head louse (_P. h. capitis_) and the\nbody louse (_P. h. humanus_). They are ectoparasites whose only known hosts\nare humans. Recent molecular data suggest that the two subspecies are ecotypes\nof the same species and that evolution between the two populations take place\ncontinually.\n\nReference: Veracz A, Raoult D. 2012. Biology and genetics of human head and\nbody lice. Trends in Parasitology. **28** : 563-571.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/pediculosis/modules/Lice_LifeCycle.gif?_=01233)\n\nThe life cycle of the head louse has three stages: egg, nymph, and adult.\n\n**Eggs:** Nits are head lice eggs. They are hard to see and are often confused\nfor dandruff or hair spray droplets. Nits are laid by the adult female and are\ncemented at the base of the hair shaft nearest the scalp ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif). They are\n0.8 mm by 0.3 mm, oval and usually yellow to white. Nits take about 1 week to\nhatch (range 6 to 9 days). Viable eggs are usually located within 6 mm of the\nscalp.\n\n**Nymphs:** The egg hatches to release a nymph ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif). The nit\nshell then becomes a more visible dull yellow and remains attached to the hair\nshaft. The nymph looks like an adult head louse, but is about the size of a\npinhead. Nymphs mature after three molts (![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif), ![The\nnumber 4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif))\nand become adults about 7 days after hatching.\n\n**Adults:** The adult louse is about the size of a sesame seed, has 6 legs\n(each with claws), and is tan to grayish-white ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif). In\npersons with dark hair, the adult louse will appear darker. Females are\nusually larger than males and can lay up to 8 nits per day. Adult lice can\nlive up to 30 days on a person’s head. To live, adult lice need to feed on\nblood several times daily. Without blood meals, the louse will die within 1 to\n2 days off the host.\n\n**Body lice:** Body lice are morphologically similar to head lice. They have a\ndifferent life cycle, whereas body lice reside on and lay their eggs on the\nclothing and fomites of infected individuals and migrate to the human body to\nfeed.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nHead lice infestation is very common and is distributed worldwide. Preschool\nand elementary-age children, 3 to 11 years of age are infested most often.\nFemales are infested more often than males, probably due to more frequent head\nto head contact. Body lice are also cosmopolitan but are less common and\nusually seen in settings of poverty, war, and homelessness.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe majority of head lice infestations are asymptomatic. When symptoms are\nnoted they may include a tickling feeling of something moving in the hair,\nitching, caused by an allergic reaction to louse saliva, and irritability.\nSecondary bacterial infection may be a complication. Body lice can serve as\nvectors for _Rickettsia prowazekii_(epidemic typhus), _Bartonella\nquintana_(trench fever), and _Borrelia recurrentis_(louse-borne relapsing\nfever).\n\n##### Modes of Transmission:\n\nThe main mode of transmission of head lice is contact with a person who is\nalready infested (i.e., head-to-head contact). Contact is common during play\n(sports activities, playgrounds, at camp, and slumber parties) at school and\nat home.\n\nLess commonly, transmission via fomites may occur with regards to head lice\n(more common with body lice). Wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats,\nsports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person; using infested\ncombs, brushes or towels; or lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed\nanimal that has recently been in contact with an infested person may result in\ntransmission. Of note, both nymph and adult lice forms need to feed on blood\nto live. If an adult louse does not have a blood meal, it can die in 2 days.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### Head and Body Lice adults.\n\nBody and head lice (_Pediculus humanus humanus_ and _P. h. capitis_ ,\nrespectively) cause a condition in humans known as Pediculosis. Although body\nlice are usually found on the torso, and head lice are found on the head and\nface, both species may change location. Adult females are approximately 3-4 mm\nlong; males are slightly smaller. _Pediculus_ can be distinguished from the\npubic lice (_Pthirus pubis_) by a larger length:width ratio of the body. The\nlegs are adapted for clinging to the host’s hair. Eggs (nits) are laid on hair\nshafts and are held tightly by a cementlike substance, making them difficult\nto remove.\n\n![](/dpdx/pediculosis/images/1/P_h_capitis_adult1.jpg?_=01221)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _P. humanus capitis_.\n\n![](/dpdx/pediculosis/images/1/P_h_capitis_female1.jpg?_=01224)\n\nFigure B: Adult female of _P. humanus capitis_.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\nThe diagnosis of pediculosis is best made by finding a live nymph or adult\nlouse on the scalp or in the hair of a person. Finding numerous nits within 6\nmm of the scalp is highly suggestive of active infestation. Finding nits only\nmore than 6 mm from the scalp is only indicative of previous infestation.\n\n",
