  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nLeishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease that is transmitted by sandflies and\ncaused by obligate intracellular protozoa of the genus _Leishmania_. Human\ninfection is caused by about 21 of 30 species that infect mammals. These\ninclude the _L. donovani_ complex with 3 species (_L. donovani_ , _L.\ninfantum_ , and _L. chagasi_); the _L. mexicana_ complex with 3 main species\n(_L. mexicana_ , _L. amazonensis_ , and _L. venezuelensis_); _L. tropica_ ;\n_L. major_ ; _L. aethiopica_ ; and the subgenus _Viannia_ with 4 main species\n(_L. (V.) braziliensis_ , _L. (V.) guyanensis_ , _L. (V.) panamensis_ , and\n_L. (V.) peruviana_). The different species are morphologically\nindistinguishable, but they can be differentiated by isoenzyme analysis,\nmolecular methods, or monoclonal antibodies.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/leishmaniasis/modules/Leishmania_LifeCycle.gif?_=00703)\n\nLeishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine\nsandflies. The sandflies inject the infective stage (i.e., promastigotes) from\ntheir proboscis during blood meals ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif).\nPromastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages\n![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif) and other\ntypes of mononuclear phagocytic cells. Promastigotes transform in these cells\ninto the tissue stage of the parasite (i.e., amastigotes) ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif), which\nmultiply by simple division and proceed to infect other mononuclear phagocytic\ncells ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif).\nParasite, host, and other factors affect whether the infection becomes\nsymptomatic and whether cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis results. Sandflies\nbecome infected by ingesting infected cells during blood meals (![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif), ![The\nnumber 6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_6.gif)).\nIn sandflies, amastigotes transform into promastigotes, develop in the gut\n![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_7.gif) (in the\nhindgut for leishmanial organisms in the _Viannia_ subgenus; in the midgut for\norganisms in the _Leishmania_ subgenus), and migrate to the proboscis ![The\nnumber 8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_8.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nLeishmaniasis is found in parts of about 88 countries. Approximately 350\nmillion people live in these areas. Most of the affected countries are in the\ntropics and subtropics. The settings in which leishmaniasis is found range\nfrom rain forests in Central and South America to deserts in West Asia. More\nthan 90 percent of the world’s cases of visceral leishmaniasis are in India,\nBangladesh, Nepal, Sudan, and Brazil.\n\nLeishmaniasis is found in Mexico, Central America, and South America—from\nnorthern Argentina to Texas (not in Uruguay, Chile, or Canada), southern\nEurope (leishmaniasis is not common in travelers to southern Europe), Asia\n(not Southeast Asia), the Middle East, and Africa (particularly East and North\nAfrica, with some cases elsewhere).\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nHuman Leishmaniasis encompasses multiple clinical syndromes, most notably\nvisceral, cutaneous, and mucosal forms. Infections can result in two main\nforms of disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis (kala-\nazar). Different species can be associated with diverse clinical\nmanifestations and sequelae. Species identification can facilitate clinical\nmanagement, such as decisions regarding whether/which treatment is indicated.\nspecies, geographic location, and immune response of the host. Cutaneous\nleishmaniasis is characterized by one or more cutaneous lesions on areas where\nsandflies have fed. Persons who have cutaneous leishmaniasis have one or more\nsores on their skin. The sores can change in size and appearance over time.\nThey often end up looking somewhat like a volcano, with a raised edge and\ncentral crater. A scab covers some sores. The sores can be painless or\npainful. Some people have swollen glands near the sores (for example, in the\narmpit if the sores are on the arm or hand).\n\nPersons who have visceral leishmaniasis usually have fever, weight loss, and\nan enlarged spleen and liver (usually the spleen is bigger than the liver).\nSome patients have swollen glands. Certain blood tests are abnormal. For\nexample, patients usually have low blood counts, including a low red blood\ncell count (anemia), low white blood cell count, and low platelet count. Some\npatients develop post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Visceral leishmaniasis\nis becoming an important opportunistic infection in areas where it coexists\nwith HIV.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\n#### Microscopy\n\nIn the human host, only the amastigotes stage is seen upon microscopic\nexamination of tissue specimens. Amastigotes can be visualized with both\nGiemsa and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains. The amastigotes of _Leishmania_\nspp. are morphologically indistinguishable from those of _Trypanosoma cruzi_.\nAmastigotes are ovoid and measure 1-5 micrometers long by 1-2 micrometers\nwide. They possess both a nucleus and kinetoplast.\n\n#### Isoenzyme analysis\n\nIsolation can be done using the biphasic medium which includes a solid phase\ncomposed of blood agar base (e.g., NNN medium), with defribinated rabbit\nblood. After isolation parasites can be characterized to the complex and\nsometimes to the species level using isoenzyme analysis, which is the\nconventional diagnostic approach for _Leishmania_ species identification.\nDiagnostic identification of _Leishmania_ using this approach may take several\nweeks.\n\n#### Serology\n\nAntibody detection can prove useful in visceral leishmaniasis but is of\nlimited value in cutaneous disease, since most patients do not develop a\nsignificant antibody response. In addition, cross reactivity can occur with\n_Trypanosoma cruzi_ , a fact to consider when investigating _Leishmania_\nantibody response in patients who have been in Central or South America.\n\n#### Molecular Diagnosis\n\nMolecular approaches have the potential to be more sensitive and rapid; e.g.,\nthe results can be available within days versus weeks. CDC has incorporated\nmolecular methods in the algorithm for the laboratory diagnosis of\nleishmaniasis. The method is based on PCR amplification using generic primers\nthat amplify a segment of the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) from\nmultiple _Leishmania_ species. DNA sequencing analysis is performed on the\namplified fragment for species identification. This approach allows the\ndifferentiation among _Viannia_ spp., namely, _L. (V.) braziliensis_ , _L.\n(V.) guyanensis_ , and _L. (V.) panamensis_ as well as _L. (L.) aethiopica_ ,\n_L. (L.) amazonensis_ , _L. (L.) donovani_ , _L. (L.) infantum/chagasi_ ,\n_(L.) major_ , _L. (L.) mexicana_ and _L. L. (L.) tropica_\n\n### Newly Released\n\n##### “[Diagnosis and Treatment of Leishmaniasis: Clinical Practice Guidelines\nby the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society\nof Tropical Medicine and Hygiene\n(ASTMH)](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/12/e202.full.pdf+html)[\n](https://www.cdc.gov/Other/disclaimer.html \"External Web Site Icon\")”\n\n",
