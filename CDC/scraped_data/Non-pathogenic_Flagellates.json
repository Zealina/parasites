  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe flagellates _Enteromonas hominis_ , _Retortamonas intestinalis_ , and\n_Pentatrichomonas hominis_ are considered non-pathogenic. These are less\nfrequently encountered than [_Chilomastix\nmesnili_](/dpdx/chilomastix/index.html) _,_ another non-pathogenic\nflagellates. The presence of cysts and/or trophozoites in stool indicates\nexposure to fecal contamination.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/nonpathogenic_flagellates/images/NP_Flagellates_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=99280)](/dpdx/nonpathogenic_flagellates/images/NP_Flagellates_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View\nLarger](/dpdx/nonpathogenic_flagellates/images/NP_Flagellates_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nBoth cysts and trophozoites of _Enteromonas hominis_ and _Retortamonas\nintestinalis_ are shed in feces; only trophozoites of _Pentatrichomonas\nhominis_(no known cyst stage) are shed in feces\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Infection occurs after\nthe ingestion of cysts (_E. hominis, R. intestinalis_)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2a.jpg) or trophozoites (_P.\nhominis_) ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2b.jpg) in fecally\ncontaminated food or water, or on fomites. Excystation of _E. hominis_ and _R.\nintestinalis_ releases trophozoites into the large intestine; _P. hominis_ is\nfound as a trophozoite throughout its life cycle. These three species colonize\nand replicate in the large intestine, where they are regarded as commensal\norganisms and are not known to cause disease.\n\n### Hosts\n\nHumans are the primary host for all three of the discussed flagellates.\nOccasionally these species are found in apes and monkeys.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nNon-pathogenic flagellates occur worldwide, and are more prevalent in areas\nwith inadequate sanitation leading to fecal contamination. _Retortamonas\nintestinalis_ is the least frequently encountered among the three species\ndiscussed here.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n_Enteromonas hominis_ , _R. intestinalis,_ and _P. hominis_ are considered\nnon-pathogenic. The presence of cysts and/or trophozoites in stool specimens\ncan however be an indicator of fecal contamination of a food or water source,\nand thus does not rule out other parasitic infections.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "_**Enteromonas hominis**_**cysts.**\n\nCysts of _Enteromonas hominis_ are ellipsoidal, measuring 4-8 µm long by 3-5\nµm wide. Cysts may contain one, two or four nuclei, with binucleate forms\nbeing the most common. In binucleate forms, the nuclei are often at opposite\npolar ends of the cyst; in forms with four nuclei, they are often paired at\nopposite ends. Nuclei possess a large, central karyosome, often surrounded by\na clear area, and do not contain peripheral chromatin.\n\n![Figure\nA](/dpdx/nonpathogenic_flagellates/images/1/E_hominis_cyst_BAM2.jpg?_=07155)\n\nFigure A: Cyst of _E. hominis_ , possessing four nuclei, in a stool specimen\nstained with iron-hematoxylin.\n\n![Figure\nB](/dpdx/nonpathogenic_flagellates/images/1/E_hominis_cyst_BAM3.jpg?_=07153)\n\nFigure B: Cyst of _E. hominis_ , possessing four nuclei, in a stool specimen\nstained with iron-hematoxylin.\n\n**Trophozoites of** _**Retortamonas intestinalis**_\n\nTrophozoites of _Retortamonas intestinalis_ are ovoid or pyriform and measure\n4—10 µm long by 3—8 µm wide.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n_Enteromonas hominis, R. intestinalis, and P. hominis_ are identified through\nthe detection of cysts and/or trophozoites in stool specimens. Identification\nis best accomplished by direct wet mounts of freshly produced stool that\nreveal the characteristic motility of the organisms. _Enteromonas hominis_\ntrophozoites present with a distinctive “jerky” slowly directional motility in\nfresh stool specimens, _R. intestinalis_ trophozoites exhibit rapidly\ndirectional corkscrew motility, while _P. hominis_ trophozoites generally do\nnot have directional motility, rather being stationary but exhibiting marked\nrapid undulations of the cytoplasmic membrane (compare these to the stiff,\nrotary movement of _Chilomastix mesnili_ or the “falling leaf” motility of\n_Giardia duodenalis_).\n\nThese protozoa may also be identified in permanent stained smears, although\ntheir affinities for stain are inconsistent and individual flagella may not be\nreadily visible. _Pentatrichomonas hominis_ trophozoites degrade rapidly and\ntimely fixation after passage is required to detect trophozoites in\npermanently stained slides.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nWhile the discussed intestinal flagellates are not pathogenic, cysts and/or\ntrophozoites are potentially infectious so [standard\nprecautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for processing\nstool samples should be followed.\n\n",
