  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Balantidium_ (=_Neobalantidium_) (=_Balantioides_) _coli,_ a large ciliated\nprotozoan, is the only ciliate known to be capable of infecting humans. It is\noften associated with swine, the primary reservoir host. Recent molecular\nanalyses have suggested the need for taxonomic revision, and it is now\nsometimes referred to as _Neobalantidium coli_ or _Balantioides coli,_\nalthough this nomenclature has neither been resolved nor widely adopted in the\nmedical community.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Life\nCycle](/dpdx/balantidiasis/modules/Balantidium_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=42868)](/dpdx/balantidiasis/modules/Balantidium_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/balantidiasis/modules/Balantidium_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nCysts are the stage responsible for transmission of balantidiasis\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . The host most often\nacquires the cyst through ingestion of contaminated food or water\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Following ingestion,\nexcystation occurs in the small intestine, and the trophozoites colonize the\nlarge intestine ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The\ntrophozoites reside in the lumen of the large intestine and appendix of humans\nand animals, where they replicate by binary fission, during which conjugation\nmay occur ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . Trophozoites\nundergo encystation to produce infective cysts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Some trophozoites invade\nthe wall of the colon and multiply, causing ulcerative pathology in the colon\nwall. Some return to the lumen and disintegrate. Mature cysts are passed with\nfeces.\n\n### Hosts\n\nSwine are the primary reservoir hosts. Humans can also be reservoirs, and\nother potential animal hosts include rodents and nonhuman primates.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Balantidium coli_ occurs worldwide. Because pigs are the primary reservoir,\nhuman infections occur more frequently in areas where pigs are raised and\nsanitation is inadequate.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMost cases are asymptomatic. Clinical manifestations, when present, may be\nacute or chronic with abdominal symptoms. Complications of associated diarrhea\nor dysentery can occur in protracted infections. Symptoms may be severe or\nfatal in debilitated/immunocompromised persons.\n\nExtraintestinal infection is rare but potentially serious and typically occurs\nsecondary to intestinal infection. Peritonitis and liver abscesses have been\nnoted following intestinal perforation or rupture of fulminant colonic ulcers.\nInvasion of urogenital tract may be caused by contamination from the anal\nregion or through fistulae caused by severe infection.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### _**Balantidium coli**_**cysts in wet mounts.\n\n**\n\nBoth _Balantidium coli_ trophozoites and cysts may be shed in stools. Both\nstages may occur in diarrheal stools, and usually only cysts are observed\nformed stools. Trophozoites are characterized by: their large size (40 µm to\n200 µm), the presence of cilia on the cell surface, a cytostome, and a bean\nshaped macronucleus which is often visible and a smaller, less conspicuous\nmicronucleus. Cysts are seen less frequently and range in size from 50 µm to\n70 µm. _B. coli_ trophozoites can also invade tissue.\n\n![](/dpdx/balantidiasis/images/1/Bcoli_cyst_wtmt3.jpg?_=04727)\n\nFigure A: _B. coli_ cyst in a wet mount, unstained.\n\n![trophozoite](/dpdx/balantidiasis/images/1/Bc_cyst_troph_B.jpg?_=19076)\n\nFigure B: _B. coli_ cyst (dart) and trophozoite (arrow) in the same field,\nfrom a primate fecal sample.\n\n_**Balantidium coli**_**trophozoites.**\n\n![trophozoite in a primate fecal\nsample](/dpdx/balantidiasis/images/2/Bc_troph_A.jpg?_=19130)\n\nFigure A: _B. coli_ trophozoite in a primate fecal sample.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is based on detection of trophozoites in stool samples from\nsymptomatic patients or in tissue collected during endoscopy. Cysts are less\nfrequently encountered, and are most likely to be recovered from formed stool.\n_Balantidium coli_ is passed intermittently and once outside the colon is\nrapidly destroyed. Thus stool specimens should be collected repeatedly, and\nimmediately examined or preserved to enhance detection of the parasite;\nconcentration via sedimentation or flotation can increase the probability of\nrecovery. Lugol’s iodine is sometimes used for staining, but may obscure\ninternal morphological features.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard protocols](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) apply for\nthe processing of stool samples. Precautions (e.g., PPE, use of a biosafety\ncabinet) should be taken to avoid accidental exposure to cysts in unfixed\nstool specimens, as these may be potentially infectious to laboratory\npersonnel.\n\n",
