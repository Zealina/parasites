  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nMany species and genotypes of the apicomplexan protozoan [\n_Cryptosporidium_](https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html) can\ninfect humans and have a wide range of host animals. Zoonotic species and\ngenotypes of _Cryptosporidium_ are those transmitted from animal hosts to\nhumans, and non-zoonotic species and genotypes are host-adapted without\nevidence of transmission from animals to humans. _Cryptosporidium parvum_\n(formerly known as _C. parvum_ genotype II) and _C. hominis_ (formerly known\nas _C. parvum_ genotype I) are the leading causes of human cryptosporidiosis.\n_C. meleagridis, C. felis, C. canis, C. ubiquitum, C. cuniculus, C. viatorum_\n, Chipmunk genotype I, _Cryptosporidium_ mink genotype, and _C. muris_ can\nalso infect humans.\n\n### Life Cycle:\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/cryptosporidiosis/modules/Cryptosporidium_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=71596)](/dpdx/cryptosporidiosis/modules/Cryptosporidium_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View\nLarger](/dpdx/cryptosporidiosis/modules/Cryptosporidium_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nSporulated oocysts, containing 4 sporozoites, are excreted by the infected\nhost through feces ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) (and\npossibly other routes such as respiratory secretions). Transmission of\n_Cryptosporidium_ spp. occurs mainly through ingestion of fecally contaminated\nwater (e.g., drinking or recreational water) or food (e.g., raw milk) or\nfollowing direct contact with infected animals or people\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Following ingestion (and\npossibly inhalation) by a suitable host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) , excystation\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_a.gif) occurs. The\nsporozoites are released and parasitize the epithelial cells (\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_b.gif) ,\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_c.gif) ) of the\ngastrointestinal tract (and possibly the respiratory tract). In these cells,\nusually within the brush border, the parasites undergo asexual multiplication\n(schizogony or merogony) (\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_d.gif) ,\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_e.gif) ,\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_f.gif) ) and then\nsexual multiplication (gametogony) producing microgamonts (male)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_g.gif) and\nmacrogamonts (female)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_h.gif) . Upon\nfertilization of the macrogamonts by the microgametes (\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_i.gif) ) that rupture\nfrom the microgamont, oocysts develop and sporulate in the infected host.\nZygotes give rise to two different types of oocysts (thick-walled and thin-\nwalled). Thick-walled oocysts are excreted from the host into the environment\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_j.gif) , whereas thin-\nwalled oocysts are involved in the internal autoinfective cycle and are not\nrecovered from stools\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/smallintestine_k.gif) . Oocysts are\ninfectious upon excretion, thus enabling direct and immediate fecal-oral\ntransmission. Extracellular stages have been reported, but their relevance in\nthe overall life cycle is unclear.\n\n### Hosts:\n\n_Cryptosporidium_ can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including\nbirds, reptiles, and mammals. Many species and genotypes are host-adapted, but\nhuman cases caused by species and genotypes that are pathogens in other\nmammals or animals have been reported (e.g. _C._  _meleagridis_).\npredominantly infects humans and is generally considered anthroponotic, though\nsporadic reports in animal hosts exist. Zoonotic subtype families of _C.\nparvum_ implicated in human infections are commonly associated with cattle,\nparticularly calves.\n\n### Geographic Range:\n\nZoonotic and non-zoonotic _Cryptosporidium_ spp. and genotypes are ubiquitous\nworldwide. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been and continue to be\nreported in several countries . Cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in the U.S. have\nbeen linked to swimming pools, water playgrounds, and other swimming venues;\nunpasteurized cider, juice, and milk; contact with animals; childcare\nsettings; camps; and ill food handlers.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nInfection with _Cryptosporidium_ spp. and genotypes results in a wide range of\nsigns and symptoms. The incubation period is an average of 7 days (range: 2–10\ndays). Immunocompetent patients may present with diarrheal illness that is\nself-limiting, typically resolving within 2–3 weeks. Immunocompromised\npatients may have more severe complications, such as life-threatening\nmalabsorption and wasting. Diarrheal illness may be accompanied by fever or\nfatigue). While the small intestine is primarily affected, extraintestinal\ncryptosporidiosis (e.g., in the pulmonary or biliary tract, rarely in the\npancreas) has been reported.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nAcid-fast staining methods, with or without stool concentration, are most\nfrequently used in clinical laboratories. Immunofluorescence microscopy has\nthe greatest sensitivity and specificity, followed closely by enzyme\nimmunoassays (EIA). Molecular methods (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR)])\nare increasingly used in reference diagnostic laboratories, since they can\nidentify _Cryptosporidium_ at the species level.\n\n**Specimen processing**\n\nStool specimens may be preserved in 10% buffered formalin (see “Laboratory\nSafety”), or suspended in a storage medium composed of aqueous potassium\ndichromate (2.5% w/v, final concentration). Formalin-based fixatives are not\nrecommended if molecular testing will be performed*. Because the number of\noocysts can vary, even in liquid stools samples, multiple stool specimens\nshould be tested before reporting a negative diagnostic interpretation. To\nmaximize recovery of oocysts, stool specimens should be concentrated prior to\nmicroscopic examination. Formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation is the\nrecommended stool concentration method. Given their small size and mass,\ncryptosporidial oocysts can become trapped in the ether or ethyl acetate plug\nand fail to sediment properly . Increased centrifugation speed or time (500 x\ng, 10 minutes) might be warranted when attempting to recover cryptosporidial\noocysts. Resolution of cryptosporidial infections is accompanied by increasing\nnumbers of non-acid-fast, oocyst “ghosts.” Such oocysts might not float or\nsediment as expected, leading to false-negative results.\n\n* Formalin is routinely used in clinical settings as a fixative of various specimen types. However, because of formalin’s unfavorable effects on nucleic acids, certain fixatives/preservatives are not recommended for molecular detection, including formalin, sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin (SAF), and low-viscosity polyvinyl alcohol (LV-PVA).\n\n**Immunoassays**\n\nDirect fluorescent antibody [DFA], EIA, and rapid immunochromatographic assays\nare commercially available in the U.S. for the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis.\nSeveral kits are combined tests for _Cryptosporidium_ , _Giardia_ , and\n_Entamoeba histolytica_. Immunodetection of antigens on the surface of\norganisms in stool specimens using DFA is highly sensitive and specific.\n\nCommercial EIA tests for the detection of _Cryptosporidium_ antigens in fresh\nor frozen stool specimens and also in stool specimens preserved in formalin or\nfixed in sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin (SAF) are available in the\nmicroplate format. Concentrated or polyvinyl alcohol-treated (PVA) specimens\nare unsuitable for testing with available antigen detection EIA kits.\n\nLaboratories that use EIA kits and rapid format assays need to be aware of\npotential problems with false positives and interpret results with caution.\n\n#### Molecular Methods\n\n**Multipathogen Molecular Panels**\n\nSeveral commercial multipathogen gastrointestinal illness panels are available\nthat include _Cryptosporidium._. The advantage of these technologies is they\ndeliver the often high sensitivity and specificity of molecular assays (e.g.\nPCR), without the need for highly trained molecular biologists. Also,\ninfections can be detected even in the absence of clinical suspicion.\n\n**Molecular Typing**\n\nMolecular methods, such as those developed and used by\n[CryptoNet](/parasites/crypto/cryptonet.html), are the only methods able to\ndifferentiate _Cryptosporidium_ species and genotypes. These are used in\nepidemiological investigations and genetic typing and not for clinical\ndiagnosis. Multiple individual protocols comprise the standardized method for\n[ _Cryptosporidium_ genotyping and\nsubtyping](/parasites/crypto/cryptonet.html) .\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions for the [processing of stool specimens\napply](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html).\n\n_Cryptosporidium_ spp. oocysts are hardy and immediately infectious, so they\npresent an infection risk for laboratory workers via accidental ingestion (or\npossibly aerosolization); therefore extra precautions must be taken. Primary\ncontainment (e.g., biosafety cabinet) and/or personal protective equipment\n(PPE; e.g., face shield) should be used when working with specimens that might\ncontain viable _Cryptosporidium_ spp. All paper towel litter and other\ndisposable materials should be autoclaved or similarly disinfected before\ndisposal. Reusable laboratory items can be washed and disinfected in a\nlaboratory dishwasher by using a detergent containing chlorine and the\n“sanitize” cycle. Alternatively, contaminated items may be immersed for\napproximately one hour in a water bath preheated to 50°C and washed thereafter\nin a detergent/disinfectant solution.\n\nAll spills and potential surface contamination with oocysts should be\ndisinfected using the following protocol: After removing organic material from\nthe contaminated surface (e.g., by using a conventional laboratory\ndetergent/cleaner) and absorbing the bulk of the spill with disposable paper\ntowels, flood and completely cover the surface with undiluted 3% hydrogen\nperoxide. Dispense hydrogen peroxide repeatedly, as needed, to keep affected\nsurfaces covered and wet/moist for approximately 30 minutes. Absorb residual\nhydrogen peroxide with disposable paper towels, and allow surfaces to dry\nthoroughly (10–30 minutes) before use.\n\n",
