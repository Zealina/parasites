Because species level identification is not typically performed\non _Acanthamoeba_ cases, the full range of pathogenic species within the genus\nis not known, but species known to infect humans include _A. byersi, A.\ncastellanii, A. culbertsoni, A. hatchetti, A. healyi, A. astroonyxix, A.\ndivionensis_ and _A. polyphaga_ _._ _B. mandrillaris_ may also occur in\nassociation with skin lesions. _Naegleria fowleri_ produces an acute, and\nusually lethal, central nervous system (CNS) disease called primary amebic\nmeningoencephalitis (PAM). _Sappinia pedata_ has been implicated in one human\ncase of amebic encephalitis.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n**_Acanthamoeba spp._ **\n\n[![Lifecycycle](/dpdx/freelivingamebic/modules/Acanthamoeba_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=72749)](/dpdx/freelivingamebic/modules/Acanthamoeba_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/freelivingamebic/modules/Acanthamoeba_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n_Acanthamoeba_ spp. are ubiquitous in the\n[environment](/parasites/acanthamoeba/gen_info/acanthamoeba.html) and have\nbeen found in a variety of sites, including soil; fresh, brackish, and sea\nwater; field-grown vegetables; sewage; swimming pools; contact lens supplies;\nmedicinal pools; dental treatment units; dialysis machines; heating,\nventilating, and air conditioning systems; and tap water; mammalian cell\ncultures; and vegetables. _Acanthamoeba_ has two stages; cysts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) and trophozoites\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) in its life cycle and\nlacks a flagellate stage. The trophozoites replicate by mitosis (nuclear\nmembrane does not remain intact)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The trophozoites are the\ninfective forms, although both cysts and trophozoites can enter the body\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) through various means.\n[Entry](/parasites/acanthamoeba/infection-sources.html) can occur through the\neye ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) , the nasal passages\nto the lower respiratory tract\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) , or ulcerated or broken\nskin ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . When _Acanthamoeba_\nspp. enters the eye it can cause severe keratitis in otherwise healthy\nindividuals, particularly contact lens users\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) . When it enters the\nrespiratory system or through the skin, it can invade the central nervous\nsystem by hematogenous dissemination causing granulomatous amebic encephalitis\n(GAE) ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) or disseminated\ndisease ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/10.jpg) , or skin lesions\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/11.jpg) in individuals with\ncompromised immune systems. Both _Acanthamoeba_ spp. cysts and trophozoites\nare found in tissue.\n\n**_Balamuthia mandrillaris_**\n\n[![Lifecycle](/dpdx/freelivingamebic/modules/Balamuthia_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=72754)](/dpdx/freelivingamebic/modules/Balamuthia_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/freelivingamebic/modules/Balamuthia_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n_Balamuthia mandrillaris_ has been isolated from soil and dust, and also from\nautopsy specimens of infected humans and animals. _B. mandrillaris_ has two\nstages, cysts ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) and\ntrophozoites ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) in its life\ncycle and lacks a flagellate stage.

The trophozoites\nreplicate by promitosis (nuclear membrane remains intact)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . _N. fowleri_ is found in\nfresh water, soil, thermal discharges of power plants, geothermal wells, and\npoorly-chlorinated recreational and tap water. Trophozoites can turn into\ntemporary non-feeding flagellated forms which usually revert back to the\ntrophozoite stage. Trophozoites infect humans or animals by penetrating the\nnasal mucosa, usually during swimming or sinus irrigation\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) , and migrating to the\nbrain ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) via the olfactory\nnerves causing primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). _Naegleria fowleri_\ntrophozoites are found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tissue, while\nflagellated forms are occasionally found in CSF. Cysts are not seen in brain\ntissue.\n\n### Hosts\n\nThere is no major reservoir host as these ameba species are free-living in the\nenvironment and are only opportunistically parasitic. However, such infections\nhave been documented in a variety of animal species.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nThese amebae occur worldwide in water and soil; below is a summary of the\nlocations where human infections are known to have occurred:\n\n[**_Acanthamoeba_****spp.**](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/acanthamoeba/gen_info/acanthamoeba.html)**:**_Acanthamoeba-_\nassociated keratitis occurs worldwide predominantly among contact lens users.\nCases of _Acanthamoeba-_ associated GAE have been reported broadly as well.\n\n[**_Balamuthia\nmandrillaris_****:**](https://www.cdc.gov/balamuthia/about/index.html) Reports\nof _B. mandrillaris_ infections primarily originate from the Americas,\nparticularly Latin America, with limited cases reported from Asia, Australia,\nand Europe. In the United States, many cases have been reported from\nsouthwestern states. Many cases reported from Peru have involved the\ndevelopment of facial skin lesions.\n\n_[**Naegleria fowleri** :](https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/)_ Cases have\nbeen reported on all inhabited continents. Most cases in the United States\nhave been associated with warm freshwater exposure in southern states.\nHowever, there have been cases reported from northern states in summer months.\n\nThe single reported case of infection with **_Sappinia pedata_** in a human\nwas identified in Texas.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n_Acanthamoeba_ spp.: Disseminated infection typically shows up as inflammation\nof the lungs or sinuses, and/or skin infections but has the potential to\nspread to the brain. GAE has a chronic onset that progressively worsens over a\nspan of weeks to months. Signs and symptoms are typical of meningoencephalitis\nand encephalitis, and involve varying degrees of neurological impairment.\nThere are very few known survivors of GAE.\n\n_Acanthamoeba_ keratitis is most commonly unilateral and individual ocular\n[symptoms](/parasites/acanthamoeba/illness.html) are variable. A\ncharacteristic circular stromal infiltrate may become apparent in the iris.\nCorneal ulceration and scarring can occur if not treated. Although highly\nassociated with contact lens use, cases occurring in the absence of contact\nlenses have occurred.\n\nCutaneous acanthamebiasis presents as a single or disseminated chronic skin\nlesions, which are most commonly crusted or ulcerated, they may be indurated\nor have an eschar. Skin infections caused by _Acanthamoeba_ can appear as\nreddish nodules, skin ulcers, or abscesses in the skin. The lesions may be\nmistaken for fungal or mycobacterial skin infection, cutaneous amebiasis\ncaused by _Entamoeba histolytica_ or cutaneous leishmaniasis. These may occur\nwith or without concurrent central nervous system disease.\n\n_Balamuthia mandrillaris_ : [Infection](/parasites/balamuthia/infection-\nsources.html) with _B. mandrillaris_ involves a similar course to\n_Acanthamoeba-_ associated GAE. The disease might appear mild at first but can\nbecome more severe over weeks to several months. Often the disease is fatal\nwith a case fatality rate of more than 89%. Plaque-like skin lesions, most\noften on the face, particularly in the cheek or nose area, but sometimes on\nthe torso or limbs may precede the development of neurological symptoms by\nweeks or months.\n\n_Naegleria fowleri:_ PAM is characterized by severe CNS dysfunction with rapid\ndegeneration caused by hemorrhagic-necrotizing meningoencephalitis. Unlike\nGAE, the onset of PAM [symptoms](/parasites/naegleria/illness.html) occurs\nquickly following infection (1-9 days; median 5 days after swimming or other\nnasal exposure to _Naegleria_ -containing water).\n[Symptoms](/parasites/naegleria/illness.html) are similar to bacterial\nmeningitis, for which it is often mistaken, with deteriorating neurological\nfunction and complications. The case fatality rate is extremely high.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n**_Acanthamoeba spp_** _._ : _Acanthamoeba_ infection can be [diagnosed by\ndetection](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/acanthamoeba/diagnosis.html) of\ntrophozoites and cysts on microscopic examination of stained smears of biopsy\nspecimens (brain tissue, skin, cornea) or of corneal scrapings. Lactophenol\nblue, acridine orange, silver, and calcofluor white stains have been used in\nthe diagnosis of acanthamoebiasis on histologic sections and environmental\nsamples (i.e. pelleted contact lens case contents). In granulomatous amebic\nencephalitis cases, trophozoites and cysts are only rarely found in the CSF.\n_Acanthamoeba_ can be cultured from clinical and environmental samples in the\nlaboratory on non-nutrient agar with a Page’s saline and _Escherichia coli_\noverlay.\n\nConfocal microscopy or cultivation of the causal organism, and its\nidentification by direct immunofluorescent antibody, may also prove useful.\nWhen there are large numbers of cysts and/or trophozoites, as in very severe\ncases, diagnosis may be possible through direct microscopy on corneal\nscrapings or contaminated surfaces (i.e. contact lens cases). An increasing\nnumber of PCR-based techniques (conventional and real-time PCR) have been\ndescribed for detection and identification of free-living amebic infections in\nthe clinical samples listed above. Such techniques may be available in\nselected reference diagnostic laboratories.\n\n**_Balamuthia mandrillaris_** infection is generally diagnosed post-mortem.\nOutside of molecular detection via PCR and recently, metagenomic deep\nsequencing, _B. mandrillaris_ is most reliably detected via immunofluorescence\nor immunoperoxidase staining of tissue samples.\n\nFor**_Naegleria fowleri_** infections, the diagnosis can be made by\nmicroscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It may be possible to\ndetect motile trophozoites on a wet mount, and a Giemsa-stained smear will\nshow trophozoites with typical morphology. PCR may be used to detect evidence\nof _N. fowleri_ in CSF and brain tissue. Amebic culture on non-nutrient agar\nplates overlaid with a fine lawn of _Escherichia coli_ enhances the likelihood\nof detection by microscopic methods.

J Clin Microbiol 2006;44(10):3589-3595.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nFree living amebae could pose a potential safety risk to laboratory staff,\nparticularly when large numbers are present in culture. Personal protective\nequipment (laboratory gown and gloves with eye protection) should be worn at\nall times, and other appropriate BSL-2 precautions should be taken.\nIndividuals with immunosuppressive illnesses or open wounds in exposed areas\nof skin may be at greater risk of infection when working with cultures of free\nliving amebae.\n\n",
