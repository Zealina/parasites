  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Ascaris_ species are very large (adult females: 20 to 35 cm; adult males: 15\nto 30 cm) nematodes (roundworms) that parasitize the human intestine._A.\nlumbricoides_ is the primary species involved in human infections globally,\nbut _Ascaris_ derived from pigs (often referred to as _A. suum_) may also\ninfect humans. These two parasites are very closely related, and hybrids have\nbeen identified; thus, their status as distinct, reproductively isolated\nspecies is a contentious topic.\n\n### Life Cycle:\n\n[![Life cycle of\nascariasis](/dpdx/ascariasis/modules/Ascariasis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=68319)](/dpdx/ascariasis/modules/Ascariasis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/ascariasis/modules/Ascariasis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nAdult worms ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) live in the\nlumen of the small intestine. A female may produce approximately 200,000 eggs\nper day, which are passed with the feces\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Unfertilized eggs may be\ningested but are not infective. Larvae develop to infectivity within fertile\neggs after 18 days to several weeks\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) , depending on the\nenvironmental conditions (optimum: moist, warm, shaded soil). After infective\neggs are swallowed ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) , the\nlarvae hatch ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) , invade the\nintestinal mucosa, and are carried via the portal, then systemic circulation\nto the lungs ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . The larvae\nmature further in the lungs (10 to 14 days), penetrate the alveolar walls,\nascend the bronchial tree to the throat, and are swallowed\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . Upon reaching the small\nintestine, they develop into adult worms. Between 2 and 3 months are required\nfrom ingestion of the infective eggs to oviposition by the adult female. Adult\nworms can live 1 to 2 years.\n\n### Hosts\n\nHumans and swine are the major hosts for _Ascaris_ ; see Causal Agents for\ndiscussion on species status of _Ascaris_ from both hosts. Natural infections\nwith _A. lumbricoides_ sometimes occur in monkeys and apes.\n\nOccasionally, _Ascaris_ sp. eggs may be found in dog feces. This does not\nindicate true infection but instead spurious passage of eggs following\ncoprophagy.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nAscariasis is the most common human helminthic infection globally. The burden\nis highest in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in areas with\ninadequate sanitation. This infection is generally rare to absent in developed\ncountries, but sporadic cases may occur in rural, impoverished regions of\nthose countries. Some cases in these areas where human transmission is\nnegligible have direct epidemiologic associations to pig farms.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nAlthough heavy infections in children may cause stunted growth via\nmalnutrition, adult worms usually cause no acute symptoms. High worm burdens\nmay cause abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction and potentially\nperforation in very high intensity infections. Migrating adult worms may cause\nsymptomatic occlusion of the biliary tract, appendicitis, or nasopharyngeal\nexpulsion, particularly in infections involving a single female worm.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### **_Ascaris lumbricoides_ unfertilized eggs.**\n\nFertilized and unfertilized _Ascaris lumbricoides_ eggs are passed in the\nstool of the infected host. Fertilized eggs are are rounded and have a thick\nshell with an external mammillated layer that is often stained brown by bile.\nIn some cases, the outer layer is absent (known as decorticated eggs). Fertile\neggs range from 45 to 75 µm in length. Unfertilized eggs are elongated and\nlarger than fertile eggs (up to 90 µm in length). Their shell is thinner and\ntheir mammillated layer is more variable, either with large protuberances or\npractically none. Unfertile eggs contain mainly a mass of refractile granules.\n\n![](/dpdx/ascariasis/images/1/Ascaris_egg_unfert.jpg?_=01127)\n\nFigure A: Unfertilized egg of _A. lumbricoides_.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs in the stool is the most common method for\ndiagnosing intestinal ascariasis. The recommended procedure is as follows:\n\n  * Collect a stool specimen.\n  * Preserve the specimen in formalin or another fixative.\n  * Concentrate using the formalin–ethyl acetate sedimentation technique\n  * Examine a wet mount of the sediment.\n\nWhere concentration procedures are not available, a direct wet mount\nexamination of the specimen is adequate for detecting moderate to heavy\ninfections. For quantitative assessments of infection, various methods such as\nthe Kato-Katz or quantitative fecal flotation can be used.\n\nLarvae can be identified in sputum or gastric aspirate during the pulmonary\nmigration phase (examine fixed organisms for morphology). Adult worms are\noccasionally passed in the stool or through the mouth or nose and are\nrecognizable by their macroscopic characteristics (e.g., presence of three\n“lips”).\n\nMolecular methods for the detection of egg/worm DNA in human stools are\nincreasingly used in research settings, often in multi-parallel formats for\ndetecting this and other soil-transmitted helminths.\n\n#### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions for the processing of [stool\nsamples](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) apply.  _Ascaris_ spp.\neggs require weeks in the environment to develop to an infective stage; thus\ninfectious eggs are not likely to be encountered in clinical specimens.\n\n",
