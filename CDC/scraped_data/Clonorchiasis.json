  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe trematode _Clonorchis sinensis_ (Chinese or oriental liver fluke) is an\nimportant foodborne pathogen and cause of liver disease in Asia. This appears\nto be the only species in the genus involved in human infection.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Life cycle of Clonorchis\nsinensis](/dpdx/clonorchiasis/modules/Clonorchis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=58717)](/dpdx/clonorchiasis/modules/Clonorchis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/clonorchiasis/modules/Clonorchis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n_Clonorchis sinensis_ eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and in the\nstool in an embryonated state\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Eggs are ingested by a\nsuitable snail intermediate host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Eggs release miracidia\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2a.jpg) , which go through\nseveral developmental stages (sporocysts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2b.jpg) , rediae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2c.jpg) , and cercariae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2d.jpg) ). The cercariae are\nreleased from the snail and, after a short period of free-swimming time in\nwater, they come in contact and penetrate the flesh of freshwater fish, where\nthey encyst as metacercariae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . Infection of humans\noccurs by ingestion of undercooked, salted, pickled, or smoked freshwater fish\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . After ingestion, the\nmetacercariae excyst in the duodenum\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) and ascend the biliary\ntract through the ampulla of Vater\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . Maturation takes\napproximately one month. The adult flukes (measuring 10 to 25 mm by 3 to 5 mm)\nreside in small and medium sized biliary ducts.\n\n### Hosts\n\nThe host range is relatively broad and _C. sinensis_ is able to infect\nmultiple species of snails and more than 100 species of freshwater fish as\nintermediate hosts. Many of the fish species belong to the Cyprinidae family,\nwhich includes carps and minnows. Additionally, _C. sinensis_ metacercariae\nhave been recovered from some species of shrimp in China and may contribute to\ndisease transmission in these locations, although prevalence and metacercarial\nburdens are much lower than in cyprinid fish. Other than humans, domestic\ncanids and felids, swine, mustelids, and other piscivorous mammals can serve\nas definitive hosts.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nEndemic areas are in East Asia (including Korea, China, Taiwan, and northern\nVietnam) and into far eastern Russia. Cases of clonorchiasis have been\nreported in non-endemic areas, including the United States, typically in Asian\nimmigrants, or following ingestion of infected undercooked/pickled freshwater\nfish imported from endemic areas.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nSymptoms are related to worm burden; most infections are of light burden and\nasymptomatic. Clinical manifestations result from inflammation, intermittent\nobstruction of the biliary ducts, mechanical injury resulting from worms\nfeeding on mucosal tissue, toxic effects of worms’ metabolic products, and\nsecondary bacterial infections. In mild cases, manifestations include mild\nabdominal symptoms. Patients with high worm burdens often have other\nnonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain (particularly in the right upper\nabdominal quadrant) and various somatic symptoms (e.g. headache, dizziness).\nWith infections of longer duration, the symptoms can be more severe, and\nhepatomegaly and malnutrition may be present. More rarely, biliary\ncomplications (e.g., cholangitis, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and\ncholangiocarcinoma), pancreatitis, and liver abscesses may develop.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### _Clonorchis sinensis_ eggs.\n\n_Clonorchis sinensis_ eggs are small, ranging in size from 27 to 35 µm by 11\nto 20 µm. The eggs are oval shaped with a convex operculum that rests on\nvisible “shoulders” at the smaller end of the egg. At the opposite\n(abopercular) end, a small knob or hook-like protrusion is often visible. The\nmiracidium is visible inside the egg. Eggs of _C. sinensis_ are highly\nmorphologically similar to _Opisthorchis_ spp.\n\n![](/dpdx/clonorchiasis/images/1/Clonorchis_egg.jpg?_=01141)\n\nFigure A: _C. sinensis_ egg: the small knob at the abopercular end is visible\nin this image.\n\n![](/dpdx/clonorchiasis/images/1/Clonorchis_egg2.jpg?_=01145)\n\nFigure B: _C. sinensis_ egg.

The oral and ventral suckers\n(acetabulum) are relatively small. Like other flukes, they are hermaphroditic.\nThe two testes are located posterior to the ovary, and are highly branched–a\nfeature which separates it from the related _Opisthorchis_ spp. (rounded\ntestes). Adults reside in the biliary passages of the liver of the definitive\nhost.\n\n![](/dpdx/clonorchiasis/images/2/Clonorchis_adult_web.jpg?_=01140)\n\nFigure A: Adult of _C. sinensis_.\n\n![C.\nsinensis](/dpdx/clonorchiasis/images/2/Clonorchis_new_labeled.jpg?_=32016)\n\nFigure B: Adult of _C. sinensis_ stained with carmine.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is usually based on microscopic identification of eggs in stool\nspecimens. However, the eggs of _Clonorchis_ are practically indistinguishable\nfrom those of _Opisthorchis_. Adult flukes have been recovered at surgery or\nmay be spontaneously passed after anthelmintic treatment. Morphologic\nexamination of the intact adult fluke allows definitive species\nidentification.\n\nSerologic testing is available for _Clonorchis_ infection by a commercial\nlaboratory in the United States.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool samples apply. _C. sinensis_ eggs in feces are not\ninfectious to humans.\n\n",
