  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nBabesiosis is caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus, _Babesia_. While\nmore than 100 species have been reported, only a few have been identified as\ncausing human infections, including _B. microti_ , _B. divergens_ , _B.\nduncani_ , and a currently un-named strain designated MO-1.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifecycle image](/dpdx/babesiosis/images/main/Babesia_LifeCycle.gif?_=00833)\n\nThe _Babesia microti_ life cycle involves two hosts, which includes a rodent,\nprimarily the white-footed mouse, _Peromyscus leucopus_ , and a tick in the\ngenus, _Ixodes_. During a blood meal, a _Babesia_ -infected tick introduces\nsporozoites into the mouse host ![The Number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif).\nSporozoites enter erythrocytes and undergo asexual reproduction (budding)\n![The Number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif). In the\nblood, some parasites differentiate into male and female gametes although\nthese cannot be distinguished at the light microscope level ![The Number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif). The\ndefinitive host is the tick. Once ingested by an appropriate tick ![The Number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif), gametes\nunite and undergo a sporogonic cycle resulting in sporozoites ![The Number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif).\nTransovarial transmission (also known as vertical, or hereditary,\ntransmission) has been documented for “large” _Babesia_ spp. but not for the\n“small” babesiae, such as _B. microti_ ![The Letter\nA](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_sq_a.gif).\n\nHumans enter the cycle when bitten by infected ticks. During a blood meal, a\n_Babesia_ -infected tick introduces sporozoites into the human host ![The\nNumber 6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_6.gif).\nSporozoites enter erythrocytes ![The Letter\nB](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/liver_sq_b.gif) and\nundergo asexual replication (budding) ![The Number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/heart_7.gif).\nMultiplication of the blood stage parasites is responsible for the clinical\nmanifestations of the disease. Humans are, for all practical purposes, dead-\nend hosts and there is probably little, if any, subsequent transmission that\noccurs from ticks feeding on infected persons. However, human to human\ntransmission is well recognized to occur through blood transfusions ![The\nNumber 8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/heart_8.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide, but little is known about the prevalence of _Babesia_ in malaria-\nendemic countries, where misidentification as _Plasmodium_ probably occurs. In\nEurope, most reported cases are due to _B. divergens_ and occur in\nsplenectomized patients. In the United States, _B. microti_ is the agent most\nfrequently identified (Northeast and Midwest), and can occur in\nnonsplenectomized individuals. _Babesia duncani_ has been isolated in patients\nin Washington and California. MO-1 has been isolated from patients in\nMissouri.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMost infections are probably asymptomatic, as indicated by serologic surveys.\nManifestations of disease include fever, chills, sweating, myalgias, fatigue,\nhepatosplenomegaly, and hemolytic anemia. Symptoms typically occur after an\nincubation period of 1 to 4 weeks, and can last several weeks. The disease is\nmore severe in patients who are immunosuppressed, splenectomized, and/or\nelderly. Infections caused by _B. divergens_ tend to be more severe\n(frequently fatal if not appropriately treated) than those due to _B. microti_\n, where clinical recovery usually occurs.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis can be made by microscopic examination of thick and thin blood\nsmears stained with Giemsa. Repeated smears may be needed.\n\n#### Antibody Detection\n\nDiagnosis of _Babesia_ infection should be made by detection of parasites in\npatients’ blood smears. However, antibody detection tests are useful for\ndetecting infected individuals with very low levels of parasitemia (such as\nasymptomatic blood donors in transfusion-associated cases), for diagnosis\nafter infection is cleared by therapy, and for discrimination between\n_Plasmodium falciparum_ and _Babesia_ infection in patients whose blood smear\nexaminations are inconclusive and whose travel histories cannot exclude either\nparasite.\n\nThe indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) using _B. microti_ parasites as\nantigen detects antibodies in 88-96% of patients with  _B. microti_ infection.\nIFA antigen slides are prepared using washed, parasitized erythrocytes\nproduced in hamsters. Patients’ titers generally rise to ≥1:1024 during the\nfirst weeks of illness and decline gradually over 6 months to titers of 1:16\nto 1:256 but may remain detectable at low levels for a year or more.\nSpecificity is 100% in patients with other tick-borne diseases or persons not\nexposed to the parasite. Cross-reactions may occur in serum specimens from\npatients with malaria infections, but generally titers are highest with the\nhomologous antigen.\n\nThe extent of cross-reactivity between _Babesia_ species is variable. A\nnegative result with _B. microti_ antigen for a patient exposed on the West\nCoast may be a false-negative reaction for _Babesia_ infection. Individuals\nwhose exposure could have occurred on the West Coast should be tested also for\nantibodies to the _Babesia duncani_ , because of the lack of cross-reactivity\nwith _B. microti_.\n\n###### Reference:\n\nKrause PJ, Telford S RI, Ryan R, et al.

In such cases, the diagnosis can be\nderived from molecular techniques, such as PCR. In addition, molecular\napproaches are very valuable in investigations of new _Babesia_ variants (or\nspecies) observed in recent human infections in the United States and in\nEurope.\n\n###### References:\n\n1\\.
