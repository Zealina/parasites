The flea is also referred to as the\njigger, nigua, chica, pico, pique or suthi.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/tungiasis/modules/Tungiasis2_LifeCycle.gif?_=01885)\n\nEggs are shed by the gravid female into the environment ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif). Eggs\nhatch into larvae ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif) in about\n3-4 days and feed on organic debris in the environment. _Tunga penetrans_ has\ntwo larval stages before forming pupae ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif). The\npupae are in cocoons that are often covered with debris from the environment\n(sand, pebbles, etc). The larval and pupal stages take about 3-4 weeks to\ncomplete. Afterwards, adults hatch from pupae ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif) and seek\nout a warm-blooded host for blood meals. Both males and females feed\nintermittently on their host, but only mated females burrow into the skin\n(epidermis) of the host, where they cause a nodular swelling ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif). Females\ndo not have any specialized burrowing organs, and simply claw into the\nepidermis after attaching with their mouthparts. After penetrating the stratum\ncorneum, they burrow into the stratum granulosum, with only their posterior\nends exposed to the environment ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_6.gif). The\nfemale fleas continue to feed and their abdomens extend up to about 1 cm.\nFemales shed about 100 eggs over a two-week period, after which they die and\nare sloughed by the hostâ€™s skin. Secondary bacterial infections are not\nuncommon with tungiasis.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Tunga penetrans_ is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the\nworld, including Mexico to South America, the West Indies and Africa. The\nfleas normally occur in sandy climates, including beaches, stables and farms.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe initial burrowing by the gravid females is usually painless; symptoms,\nincluding itching and irritation, usually start to develop as the females\nbecome fully-developed into the engorged state. Inflammation and ulceration\nmay become severe, and multiple lesions in the feet can lead to difficulty in\nwalking. Secondary bacterial infections, including tetanus and gangrene, are\nnot uncommon with tungiasis.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Tunga penetrans_.\n\n_Tunga penetrans_ (also known as chigoe flea, jigger, nigua, chica, pico,\ncique, or suthi) burrows under the skin of humans, unlike other fleas which\nare ectoparasitic on the surface of the skin. The females remain embedded in\nthe host tissue during engorgement and egg-production. The fleas are usually\nfound between the toes or under toe nails, and humans acquire the infection\nwhen walking barefoot in tropical and subtropical regions. Adults may be\ndissected out of lesions and are characterized by a lack of both pronotal and\ngenal combs.\n\n![](/dpdx/tungiasis/images/1/T_penetrans_HB1.jpg?_=01892)\n\nFigure A: _Tunga penetrans_ removed from a lesion on the bottom of the foot of\na patient who traveled to Africa. The bulk of the lesion and the posterior\npart of the flea are marked with a blue arrow. The anterior end of the flea,\nshowing the head, mouthparts and forelegs, is marked with a green arrow.
