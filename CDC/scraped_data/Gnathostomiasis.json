  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Gnathostoma_ spp. are spirurid nematodes characterized by the presence of a\nprominent cephalic bulb and body spines, and are typically associated with\ncarnivorous mammal definitive hosts. Humans are accidental hosts; the only\nforms found in humans are larvae or immature adults that never reach\nreproductive maturity. Most human infections are caused by _G. spinigerum_ ;\nother species confirmed to be zoonotic include _G. hispidum_ ,_G. doloresi_\n,_G. binucleatum_ , and _G. nipponicum_. Two unconfirmed human cases of _G.\nmalaysiae_ infection have been reported from Myanmar.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/gnathostomiasis/modules/Gnathostoma_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=52320)](/dpdx/gnathostomiasis/modules/Gnathostoma_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/gnathostomiasis/modules/Gnathostoma_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nIn definitive hosts, adult worms of most _Gnathostoma_ spp reside in a tumor-\nlike mass in the gastric wall; adult worms of some species are found in the\nesophagus or kidney. Adults mate and produce unembryonated eggs, which pass\nthrough a small opening in the tumor-like mass and ultimately into the feces\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Eggs become embryonated\nin water, and eggs release sheathed first-stage larvae (L1)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Freshwater copepods,\nwhich serve as first intermediate hosts, ingest the free-swimming L1, and the\nlarvae molt twice to become early third-stage larvae (EL3)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . Following ingestion of\nthe copepod by a suitable second intermediate host, the EL3 migrate into the\ntissues of the host and develop further into advanced L3 larvae (AL3)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . When the second\nintermediate host is ingested by a definitive host, the AL3 develop into adult\nparasites in the gastric wall\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Alternatively, the\nsecond intermediate host may be ingested by a paratenic host, in which the AL3\ndo not develop further but remain infective\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . Humans become infected\nby eating raw or undercooked meat of second intermediate or paratenic hosts\ncontaining AL3. In the human host, AL3 migrate in various tissues and may\ndevelop into immature adults but never achieve reproductive maturity; they may\nrange in size from 2 mm to about 2 cm depending on the species and the extent\nof development ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . Whether\nhumans can become infected by drinking water that contains infected copepods\nis not clear.\n\n### Hosts\n\nCarnivorous and sometimes omnivorous mammals serve as definitive hosts for\n_Gnathostoma_ spp., including canids and felids for _G. spinigerum_ and _G.\nbinucleatum_ , swine for _G. hispidum_ and _G. doloresi_ , and weasels for _G.\nnipponicum._\n\nSeveral members of the freshwater copepod family Cyclopidae appear to be\ncompetent first intermediate hosts. _Gnathostoma_ spp. larvae have been found\nin a broad range of second intermediate and paratenic hosts. Second\nintermediate hosts are typically aquatic animals that feed on copepods (e.g.,\nfish, amphibians), and paratenic hosts are usually animals that prey on these\nsecond intermediate hosts (e.g., snakes, birds).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nMost human cases of gnathostomiasis are reported from _Gnathostoma_ -endemic\nregions in which raw fish dishes (e.g., sushi, ceviche) are popular,\nparticularly in Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Mexico. In the United States,\ncases of gnathostomiasis are most commonly reported in Southeast Asian\nimmigrants.\n\n_Gnathostoma spinigerum_ ,_G. doloresi_ , and _G. hispidum_ are endemic in\nEast and Southeast Asia. In tropical Australia, _G. spinigerum_ and _G.\nhispidum_ have been reported sporadically in definitive hosts and several\nhuman cases of _Gnathostoma_ infection that were diagnosed solely on the basis\nof serologic testing have been reported. _G. doloresi_ is found in swine in\nparts of Central and Eastern Europe. _G. nipponicum_ has been identified in\nJapan and China only. Occasional cases of gnathostomiasis associated with\nexposures in Africa (Zambia, Botswana, and Tanzania) have been reported; the\ncausative species was identified for only one of the cases (as _G. spinigerum_\nfor a case in a tourist who had visited Botswana).\n\nSeveral _Gnathostoma_ spp. occur in New World animal hosts. However, the only\nspecies known to be zoonotic in this range is _G. binucleatum_ , a species\nthat has considerable morphologic overlap with _G. spinigerum_ , and has been\nimplicated as the cause of many human cases of gnathostomiasis in Mexico and\nEcuador. On the basis of serologic evidence, _G. binucleatum_ may have caused\nadditional cases of gnathostomiasis in other South American countries. On the\nbasis of molecular data, the reported Latin American cases of gnathostomiasis\nhistorically attributed to _G. spinigerum_ or _G. spinigerum_ -like species\nwere most likely caused by _G. binucleatum._\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe clinical manifestations in humans are caused by migration of the advanced\nL3 larvae or immature adults, which can invade a variety of tissues.\nEosinophilia is commonly observed during initial larval migration (e.g., in\nthe skin and subcutaneous tissue) but is not always present in chronically\ninfected persons. Cutaneous gnathostomiasis, the most common form of the\ndisease, results from migration of the parasite in subcutaneous tissue, which\ncan be associated with intermittent migratory swellings (often on the torso or\nupper limbs). These swellings can be erythematous, pruritic, and/or painful\nand may recur over months or years if the infection is not treated. In some\npatients, the parasite migrates near the surface of the skin and can be\nextracted or may spontaneously emerge.\n\nMigration in deeper tissues (such as pulmonary, gastrointestinal,\ngenitourinary, auricular, ocular tissue, or the central nervous system) is\nreferred to as visceral gnathostomiasis or larva migrans profundus. Clinical\nmanifestations are highly variable and depend in part on which tissues are\naffected. Neurognathostomiasis can be associated with potentially fatal\neosinophilic meningitis and myeloencephalitis, and ocular gnathostomiasis may\ncause vision loss.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Morphologic Diagnosis\n\nMorphologic diagnosis is achieved by identifying _Gnathostoma_ larval forms or\nimmature adults in a biopsy specimen or after extraction from a cutaneous\nlesion. In histologic sections, _Gnathostoma_ spp. often can be differentiated\nfrom each other on the basis of the morphologic features of their intestinal\nepithelial cells.\n\n### Antibody Detection\n\nSerologic tests for _Gnathostoma_ infection are not available at CDC or\nelsewhere in the United States. Please contact _DPDx_ for contact information\nfor laboratories in Thailand and Japan that perform serologic testing.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard laboratory precautions apply for the processing and examination of\nhistologic sections. No stages of _Gnathostoma_ spp. examined in diagnostic\nlaboratories represent an infectious risk.\n\n",
