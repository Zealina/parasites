  "parasite_biology": "### Causative Agents\n\nThe causative agents of lymphatic filariasis (LF) include the mosquito-borne\nfilarial nematodes _Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, B. timori_ An\nestimated 90% of LF cases are caused by _W. bancrofti_(Bancroftian\nfilariasis)_._\n\n#### _Brugia Malayi_ Life Cycle\n\n[![B_malayi_LifeCycle](/dpdx/lymphaticfilariasis/modules/B_malayi_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=07593)](/dpdx/lymphaticfilariasis/modules/B_malayi_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/lymphaticfilariasis/modules/B_malayi_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nDuring a blood meal, an infected mosquito (typically _Mansonia_ spp. and\n_Aedes_ spp.) introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the skin of the\nhuman host, where they penetrate into the bite wound\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . They develop into adults\nthat commonly reside in the lymphatics\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . The adult worms\noutwardly resemble those of _Wuchereria bancrofti_ but are smaller. Female\nworms measure 43 to 55 mm in length by 130 to 170 μm in width, and males\nmeasure 13 to 23 mm in length by 70 to 80 μm in width. Adults produce\nmicrofilariae, measuring 177 to 230 μm in length and 5 to 7 μm in width, which\nare sheathed and have nocturnal periodicity (in some regions _B. malayi_ may\nbe sub-periodic, and note that microfilariae are usually not produced in _B.\npahangi_ infections). The microfilariae migrate into lymph and enter the blood\nstream reaching the peripheral blood\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . A mosquito ingests the\nmicrofilariae during a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . After ingestion, the\nmicrofilariae lose their sheaths and work their way through the wall of the\nproventriculus and cardiac portion of the midgut to reach the thoracic muscles\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . There the microfilariae\ndevelop into first-stage larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) and subsequently into\nthird-stage larvae ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . The\nthird-stage larvae migrate through the hemocoel to the mosquito’s proboscis\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) and can infect another\nhuman when the mosquito takes a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg).\n\n#### _Wuchereria bancrofti_ Life Cycle\n\n[![W_bancrofti_LifeCycle](/dpdx/lymphaticfilariasis/modules/W_bancrofti_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=07648)](/dpdx/lymphaticfilariasis/modules/W_bancrofti_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/lymphaticfilariasis/modules/W_bancrofti_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nDuring a blood meal, an infected mosquito introduces third-stage filarial\nlarvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite\nwound ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . They develop in\nadults that commonly reside in the lymphatics\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . The female worms measure\n80 to 100 mm in length and 0.24 to 0.30 mm in diameter, while the males\nmeasure about 40 mm by 1 mm. Adults produce microfilariae measuring 244 to 296\nμm by 7.5 to 10 μm, which are sheathed and have nocturnal periodicity, except\nthe South Pacific microfilariae which have the absence of marked periodicity.\nThe microfilariae migrate into lymph and blood channels moving actively\nthrough lymph and blood ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) .\nA mosquito ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . After ingestion, the\nmicrofilariae lose their sheaths and some of them work their way through the\nwall of the proventriculus and cardiac portion of the mosquito’s midgut and\nreach the thoracic muscles ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg)\n. There the microfilariae develop into first-stage\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) larvae and subsequently\ninto third-stage infective larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . The third-stage\ninfective larvae migrate through the hemocoel to the mosquito’s prosbocis\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) and can infect another\nhuman when the mosquito takes a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) .\n\n#### Hosts and Vectors\n\n_Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi,_ and _B. timori_ are considered human\nparasites as animal reservoirs are of minor epidemiologic importance or\nabsent; felid species and some primates are the primary reservoir hosts of\nzoonotic _B. pahangi._\n\nThe typical vector for _Brugia_ spp. filariasis are mosquito species in the\ngenera _Mansonia_ and _Aedes_. _W. bancrofti_ is transmitted by many different\nmosquito genera/species, depending on geographical distribution. Among them\nare _Aedes_ spp., _Anopheles_ spp., _Culex_ spp., _Mansonia_ spp., and\n_Coquillettida juxtamansonia._\n\n#### Geographic Distribution\n\n_W. bancrofti_ was once widespread in tropical regions globally but control\nmeasures have reduced its geographic range. It is currently endemic throughout\nSub-Saharan Africa (excluding the southern portion of the continent),\nMadagascar, several Western Pacific Island nations and territories and parts\nof the Caribbean. Bancroftian filariasis also occurs sporadically in South\nAmerica, India, and Southeast Asia.\n\n_Brugia_ spp. associated with LF are more geographically limited and occur\nonly in Southeast Asia. Like _W. bancrofti_ , control measures have reduced\nthe occurrence and endemic range considerably. _Brugia timori_ is restricted\nto the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia.\n\n#### Clinical Features\n\nWhile severe manifestations do not develop in the majority of infections, LF\nis a potentially highly disfiguring and disabling disease. The most prominent\nclinical feature is the development of severe lymphedema of the limbs\n(“elephantiasis”) and occasionally genitalia (hydrocele) due to dysfunction of\nlymphatic vessels. Affected limbs become grossly swollen; the skin may become\nthick and pitted, and secondary infection are frequent due to lymphatic\ndysfunction. Scrotal hydrocele is also seen in some infected males.\nLymphangitis, lymphadenopathy, and eosinophilia may accompany infection in the\nearly stages.\n\nA chronic syndrome called “tropical pulmonary eosinophilia” has been\nassociated with _W. bancrofti_ and _B. malayi_ infections, involving\neosinophilic pulmonary infiltrate, peripheral hypereosinophilia, wheezing,\nchest pain, splenomegaly, and bloody sputum. This has most frequently been\ndocumented in South and Southeast Asia.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Diagnostic Findings\n\n#### Microscopy\n\nLymphatic filariasis is usually identified by the finding of microfilaria in\nperipheral blood smears (thick or thin) stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin-\nand-eosin and subsequent morphologic species identification. For increased\nsensitivity, concentration techniques can be used. These include\ncentrifugation of the blood sample lysed in 2% formalin ([Knott’s\ntechnique](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/blood/specimenproc.html)), or filtration\nthrough a polycarbonate membrane. Microfilariae of _Wuchereria bancrofti_ and\n_Brugia spp._ exhibit a nocturnal periodicity and an accurate diagnosis is\nbest achieved on blood collected at night. _W. bancrofti_ that are sub-\nperiodic may be encountered in some regions of the Pacific Islands, eastern\nMalaysia, and Vietnam. Sub-periodic _B. malayi_ also occurs in parts of\nMalaysia. Adults of both species may be identified in biopsy specimens of\nlymphatic tissue.\n\n#### Antigen Detection\n\nAntigen detection using an immunoassay for circulating filarial antigens\nconstitutes a useful diagnostic approach because sensitivity for detection of\nmicrofilariae can be low and variable. Unlike microfilariae with nocturnal\nperiodicity, filarial antigens can be detected in blood samples collected at\nany time of day. A rapid format immunochromatographic test has been shown to\nbe a useful and sensitive tool for the detection of _Wuchereria bancrofti_\nantigen and is being used widely by lymphatic filariasis elimination programs.\nCurrently, this test is not licensed for use in the United States and cannot\nbe used for patient diagnosis.\n\n#### Antibody Detection\n\nSerologic enzyme immunoassay tests, including antifilarial IgG1 and IgG4,\nprovide an alternative to microscopic detection of microfilariae for the\ndiagnosis of lymphatic filariasis. Patients with active filarial infection\ntypically have elevated levels of antifilarial IgG4 in the blood and these can\nbe detected using routine assays.\n\n#### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/blood/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of blood specimens apply.\n\n",
