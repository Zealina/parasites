  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Blastocystis_ is a genetically diverse unicellular parasite of unclear\npathogenic potential that colonizes the intestines of humans and a wide range\nof non-human animals. On the basis of molecular data, the organism has been\nclassified as a stramenopile. Organisms such as diatoms, chrysophytes, water\nmolds, and slime nets are other examples of stramenopiles.\n\n_Blastocystis_ organisms isolated from humans have commonly been referred to\nas _B. hominis_. However, because of extensive genetic diversity (even among\norganisms isolated from humans) and low host specificity, the designation\n_Blastocystis_ sp. is considered more appropriate. If genetic typing is\nperformed, the subtype (ST) also should be noted in accordance with consensus\nterminology.* Among the nine STs found to date in humans, the four most\nprevalent STs are ST1, ST2, ST3, and ST4; other STs occur sporadically and may\nbe related to zoonotic transmission.\n\n* Stensvold, C.R., Suresh, G.K., Tan, K.S., Thompson, R.A., Traub, R.J., Viscogliosi, E., Yoshikawa, H. and Clark, C.G., 2007. Terminology for _Blastocystis_ subtypes–a consensus. _Trends in Parasitology_ , 23 (3), pp.93-96.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/blastocystis/modules/Blastocystis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=08552)](/dpdx/blastocystis/modules/Blastocystis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/blastocystis/modules/Blastocystis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nThe life cycle of _Blastocystis_ sp. is not yet understood, including the\ninfectious stage and whether (and which of the) various morphologic forms of\nthis polymorphic organism that have been identified in stool or culture\nconstitute distinct biologic stages of the parasite in the intestinal tract of\nhosts. The cyst form (3–5 µm) is postulated to be an infectious stage, but not\nconfirmed. The predominant form found in human stool specimens is referred to\nas the vacuolar (or central body) form and is of variable size (5–40 µm,\noccasionally much larger). Replication appears to occur via binary fission.\nOther morphologic forms (e.g., ameboid and granular forms) also have been\nnoted in stool samples and/or culture; their biological role and eventual\ndevelopmental fate require further investigation.\n\n### Hosts\n\n_Blastocystis_ has been detected in stool from humans and a wide range of non-\nhuman animals (e.g. canids, swine, primates, rodents, birds, etc.).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Blastocystis_ sp. is found worldwide. Efforts to characterize the geographic\nand host distribution of _Blastocystis_ subtypes are ongoing.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nWhether _Blastocystis_ sp. (or particular subtypes thereof or particular\nstrains of certain subtypes) can cause gastrointestinal disease (symptomatic\ninfection) in humans continues to be debated and investigated. _Blastocystis_\nsp. has been detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "_**Blastocystis**_**sp.****vacuolar forms in wet mounts.**\n\n_Blastocystis_ sp. in human stool specimens usually appears as spherical to\noval vacuolar forms, which can vary widely in size (5 to 40 µm, occasionally\nmuch larger in culture; usual range in human stool is 8 to 10 µm) and\ntypically consist of a central body, or “vacuole,” surrounded by a thin rim of\ncytoplasm containing up to six nuclei. The vacuoles stain variably from red to\nblue with trichrome; the staining facilitates detection and identification of\nthe organism (e.g., differentiation from fecal debris). Other morphologic\nforms occasionally are noted in human stool specimens.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/blastocystis/images/1/Bhominis_cyst_wtmt.jpg?_=05110)\n\nFigure A: _Blastocystis_ sp. in an unstained wet mount.\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/blastocystis/images/1/Bhominis_cyst_wtmt2.jpg?_=05109)\n\nFigure B: _Blastocystis_ sp. in an unstained wet mount.\n\n_**Blastocystis sp.**_**vacuolar forms in wet mounts under differential\ninterference contrast (DIC) microscopy.**\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/blastocystis/images/2/Bhominis_cyst_DIC.jpg?_=05106)\n\nFigure A: _Blastocystis_ sp. in a wet mount under differential interference\ncontrast (DIC) microscopy.\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/blastocystis/images/2/Bhominis_cyst_DIC2.jpg?_=05105)\n\nFigure B: _Blastocystis_ sp. in a wet mount under differential interference\ncontrast (DIC) microscopy.\n\n_**Blastocystis**_**sp. vacuolar forms in wet mounts stained with iodine.**\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/blastocystis/images/3/Bhominis_cyst_wtmt_io.jpg?_=05127)\n\nFigure A: _Blastocystis_ sp. in a wet mount stained with iodine.\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/blastocystis/images/3/Bhominis_cyst_wtmt_io2.jpg?_=05125)\n\nFigure B: _Blastocystis_ sp. in a wet mount stained with iodine.\n\n_**Blastocystis sp.**_**vacuolar forms stained with trichrome.**\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/blastocystis/images/4/Bhominis_cyst_tric.jpg?_=05116)\n\nFigure A: _Blastocystis_ sp. stained with trichrome.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is based on identifying _Blastocystis_ sp. (almost always the\nvacuolar form) in stool specimens. Permanently stained slides are preferred\nover unstained wet-mount preparations; in wet mounts, fecal debris may be\nmistaken for _Blastocystis_ sp. and vice versa. Molecular methods are\ngenerally only used in research settings.\n\n#### Morphology\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n__\n\n#### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions apply for the [processing of stool\nspecimens](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html).\n\n",
