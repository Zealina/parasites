  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Giardia duodenalis_ is a protozoan flagellate (Diplomonadida).\n\n### Life Cycle:\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/giardiasis/modules/Giardia_LifeCycle.gif?_=04313)\n\nCysts are resistant forms and are responsible for transmission of giardiasis.\nBoth cysts and trophozoites can be found in the feces (diagnostic stages)\n![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif).\nThe cysts are hardy and can survive several months in cold water. Infection\noccurs by the ingestion of cysts in contaminated water, food, or by the fecal-\noral route (hands or fomites) ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/Stomach_2.gif). In the\nsmall intestine, excystation releases trophozoites (each cyst produces two\ntrophozoites) ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_3.gif).\nTrophozoites multiply by longitudinal binary fission, remaining in the lumen\nof the proximal small bowel where they can be free or attached to the mucosa\nby a ventral sucking disk ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_4.gif).\nEncystation occurs as the parasites transit toward the colon. The cyst is the\nstage found most commonly in nondiarrheal feces ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif).\nBecause the cysts are infectious when passed in the stool or shortly\nafterward, person-to-person transmission is possible. While animals are\ninfected with _Giardia_ , their importance as a reservoir is unclear.\n\n### Geographic Distribution:\n\nWorldwide, more prevalent in warm climates, and in children.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe spectrum varies from asymptomatic carriage to severe diarrhea and\nmalabsorption. Acute giardiasis develops after an incubation period of 1 to 14\ndays (average of 7 days) and usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. Symptoms include\ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. In chronic\ngiardiasis the symptoms are recurrent and malabsorption and debilitation may\noccur.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n![G. duodenalis cysts and C. parvum oocysts -\nIFA](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/giardiasis/Giardia_cyst_IFA.jpg)\n\nCysts of _G. duodenalis_ (lower right) and _Cryptosporidium_ (upper left)\nlabeled with commercially available immunofluorescent antibodies.\n\nGiardiasis is diagnosed by the identification of cysts or trophozoites in the\nfeces, using direct mounts as well as concentration procedures. Cysts are\ntypically seen in wet mount preparations, while trophozoites are seen in\npermanent mounts (i.e. trichrome). Repeated samplings may be necessary. In\naddition, samples of duodenal fluid (e.g., Enterotest) or duodenal biopsy may\ndemonstrate trophozoites. Alternate methods for detection include antigen\ndetection tests by enzyme immunoassays, and detection of parasites by\nimmunofluorescence. Both methods are available in commercial kits.\n\n#### Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA)\n\nA direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) is available for diagnosing _Giardia\nduodenalis_ infections. Antibodies tagged with fluorescent markers are added\nto stool and incubated. Visualization under a fluorescent microscope shows the\n_Giardia_ cysts as green, glowing ovoid objects. This test includes antibodies\nfor _Cryptosporidium_ and both diseases can be tested for simultaneously.\n\n#### Bench Aids\n\n[![A thumbnail for the linked\ndocument.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/resources/pdf/benchAids/giardia_benchaid.jpg)Laboratory\nDiagnosis of Giardiasis — _Giardia duodenalis_ ![Adobe PDF\nfile](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/images/icon_pdf.gif) [PDF, 108 KB, 2\nPages]](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/Giardia_benchaid.pdf)\n\n",
