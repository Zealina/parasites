  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nAnisakiasis is caused by the ingestion of larvae of several species of\nascaridoid nematodes (roundworms), which are sometimes called “herringworm”,\n“codworm”, or “sealworm”, in undercooked marine fish. Known human-infecting\nanisakid species include members of the **_Anisakis simplex_** complex [_A.\nsimplex_ sensu stricto, _A. pegreffii, A. berlandi_(=_A. simplex_ C)], the\n**_Pseudoterranova decipiens_** complex (_P. decipiens_ sensu stricto,_P.\nazarasi, P. cattani,_ and others), and the **_Contracecum osculatum_**\ncomplex. Recent genetic studies have revealed high diversity within these\nanisakid groups, suggesting additional cryptic species are likely represented\nin zoonotic infections.\n\n### Life Cycle:\n\n[![lifecycle\nimage](/dpdx/anisakiasis/modules/Anisakis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=42579)](/dpdx/anisakiasis/modules/Anisakis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/anisakiasis/modules/Anisakis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nAdult stages of anisakid nematodes reside in the stomach of marine mammals,\nwhere they are embedded in the mucosa in clusters. Unembryonated eggs produced\nby adult females are passed in the feces of marine mammals\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . The eggs become\nembryonated in water, undergoing two developmental molts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2a.jpg) , and hatch from the eggs\nas free-swimming ensheathed third-stage (L3) larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2b.jpg) . These free-swimming\nlarvae are then ingested by crustaceans\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The ingested larvae grow\nwithin the crustacean hemocoel, and become infective to fish and cephalopod\nparatenic hosts. After preying upon infected crustaceans, the digested L3\nlarvae migrate from the paratenic host intestine into the abdominal cavity,\nand eventually to the tissues of the mesenteries and skeletal muscle. Through\npredation, tissue-stage L3 larvae can be transmitted among paratenic hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . Fish and squid maintain\nL3 larvae that are infective to humans and marine mammals\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) .\n\nWhen fish or squid containing third-stage larvae are ingested by definitive\nhost marine mammals, the larvae molt twice and develop into adult worms\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . After ingestion by\nhumans, the anisakid larvae penetrate the gastric and intestinal mucosa,\ncausing the symptoms of anisakiasis\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\nDefinitive hosts include several cetacean species for **_Anisakis simplex_**\nsensu lato, and pinnipeds for **_Pseudoterranova decipiens_** sensu lato. The\nbearded seal (_Erignathus barbatus_) and gray seal (_Halichoerus grypus_) are\nknown definitive hosts for **_Contracecum osculatum_** complex. Human-\ninfecting anisakid species are found in a wide variety of marine fish\nintermediate and paratenic hosts, but are most common in predatory species\nsuch as herring, cod, mackerel, and sculpin.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nAnisakiasis occurs worldwide due to the global trade of seafood, though the\ncausative agents vary in geographic occurrence in their natural hosts.\n_Anisakis simplex_ complex members occur in broadly both deep sea and coastal\nenvironments in the Atlantic Basin, Pacific Ocean, and Alaskan coast (_A.\nsimplex_ sensu stricto); _A. pegreffii_ occurs in the Southern hemisphere. The\n_Pseudoterranova decipiens_ complex is generally more geographically\nrestricted than _Anisakis_ spp., occurring in cold-water coastal environments\nsuch as the Northern Atlantic, the Arctic and South (Antarctic) Oceans, Japan,\nand off the southern coast of Chile. _Contracecum osculatum_ complex species\nalso occur in these colder regions.\n\nIncidence of human infections is highest in areas where raw fish dishes (e.g.\nsashimi, ceviche, pickled/marinated fish) are popular. It is particularly\ncommon in Japan, the Pacific coast of South America, and parts of Northern\nEurope.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nAnisakiasis involves acute abdominal symptoms, usually within hours after\ningestion of larvae. This nonspecific abdominal distress can be mistaken for\nother conditions such as peptic ulcers, food poisoning, and appendicitis.\nOccasionally, the larvae are coughed up. If the larvae pass into the bowel, a\nsevere eosinophilic granulomatous response may also occur 1 to 2 weeks\nfollowing infection, causing symptoms mimicking Crohn’s disease, and rarely,\nintestinal perforation can occur. Rare cases of ectopic infection are known,\nin sites such as the peritoneal cavity, mesentery, esophagus, and tongue.\n\nMost infections are self-limiting as larvae are unable to survive for long\nperiods in the human host, but the associated tissue damage can cause longer\nlasting symptoms. Antigens that remain in the fish muscle after the larvae are\nkilled (e.g. after freezing) can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.\n\n",

Worms may be coughed up and brought in by patients.\n\nGenus-level identification is not required for patient management but may be\naccomplished by examination of digestive structures and lateral chords.\nExamination of esophageal and intestinal morphology usually requires clearing\nin lactophenol.\n\n### Laboratory safety\n\nStandard laboratory protocols for the examination of histological sections\nand/or worm specimens apply.\n\n",
