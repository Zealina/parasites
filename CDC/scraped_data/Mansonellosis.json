  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThree species of _Mansonella,_ a vector-borne filarial nematode genus, are\nassociated with human infections: _M. ozzardi,_ and _M.\nperstans_(=_Dipetalonema perstans_), and _M. streptocerca (=Dipetalonema\nstreptocerca_)_._ These species vary in their geographic occurrence and\nlocalization within the host. Recently, a novel molecular clade of _M.\nperstans_ , _M. perstans_ “deux” has been reported from both Brazil and Gabon.\nOn rare occasions, zoonotic species such as _M. rodhaini_ and other\nunidentified _Mansonella_ sp. have been detected in human infections.\n\n### Life Cycles\n\n#### _Mansonella perstans_\n\n####\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/mansonellosis/modules/M_perstans_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=82821)](/dpdx/mansonellosis/modules/M_perstans_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/mansonellosis/modules/M_perstans_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nDuring a blood meal, an infected midge introduces third-stage (L3) larvae onto\nthe skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . They develop into adults\nthat reside in body cavities, most commonly the peritoneal cavity or pleural\ncavity, and less frequently in the pericardium\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . The size range for\nfemale worms is 70 to 80 mm in length and 120 µm in diameter, and the males\nmeasure approximately 45 mm by 60 µm. Adults produce unsheathed, subperiodic\nmicrofilariae (200 µm long, 4.5 µm wide) which enter peripheral circulation\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . A midge vector ingests\nmicrofilariae during a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . After ingestion, the\nmicrofilariae migrate from the midge’s midgut through the hemocoel to the\nthoracic muscles of the arthropod\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . There the microfilariae\ndevelop into first-stage larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) and subsequently into\nthird-stage infective larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . The third-stage\ninfective larvae migrate to the midge’s proboscis\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) and can infect another\nhuman when the midge takes a blood meal\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) .\n\n#### _Mansonella ozzardi_\n\n[![](/dpdx/mansonellosis/modules/M_ozzardi_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=82819)](/dpdx/mansonellosis/modules/M_ozzardi_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/mansonellosis/modules/M_ozzardi_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nDuring a blood meal, an infected arthropod (midges, genus _Culicoides_ , or\nblackflies, genus _Simulium_) introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the\nskin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . They develop into adults\nthat commonly reside in subcutaneous tissues\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Adult worms are small\nand slender, measuring about 49 mm long and 150 µm wide (females) or 26 mm\nlong and 70 µm wide (males). Adults produce unsheathed and non-periodic\nmicrofilariae that reach the blood stream\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) .

The females measure\napproximately 27 mm in length, and are 50 µm wide at the level of the vulva\n(anteriorly) and ovaries (near the posterior end), and up to 85 µm at the mid-\nbody. Males measure 50 µm in diameter. Adults produce unsheathed and non-\nperiodic microfilariae, measuring 180 to 240 µm by 3 to 5 µm, which reside in\nthe skin but can also reach the peripheral blood\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) .

The primary\nvectors are biting midges of the genus _Culicoides_.\n\n_M. ozzardi_ also seems to be associated primarily with humans, but patas\nmonkeys (_Erythrocebus patas_) have been experimentally infected. The primary\nvectors are biting midges of the genus _Culicoides_. In some areas of South\nAmerica, the black fly _Simulium amazonicum_ and in Haiti, the midge\n_Leptoconops bequaerti_ may act as concurrent vectors.\n\n_M. streptocerca_ is primarily a parasite of humans, but infections in wild\nchimpanzees have been reported on rare occasions. Like other _Mansonella_\nspp., the primary vectors are biting midges of the genus _Culicoides._\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Mansonella perstans_ is endemic throughout West, East, and Central Africa,\nand is also highly prevalent in some neotropical regions of Central and South\nAmerica where it was likely introduced.\n\n_M. ozzardi_ is a New World species with a patchy distribution, and is found\nin Central America, South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,\nGuyana, Suriname and Venezuela) and several Caribbean islands.\n\n_M. streptocerca_ is an Old World species that occurs in tropical regions of\nWest and Central Africa.\n\nGenerally, the transmission of _Mansonella_ spp. is highly focal and local\nprevalence varies widely within endemic regions. Travel-related cases in\nresidents of non-endemic countries are unusual but have been documented.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nIn contrast to other filarial diseases (Bancroftian filariasis,\nonchocerciasis, and loiasis) which more commonly cause illness in infected\npeople, the clinical presentation of most _Mansonella_ infections generally\nappears to be mild; many infections are asymptomatic, particularly among\nindividuals living in endemic regions. A complicating feature of _Mansonella_\ninfections is that their geographic distribution overlaps that of other\nfilarial diseases that may have similar clinical manifestations. It is\ndifficult to be certain that symptoms identified in cross-sectional studies of\npatients in endemic areas were due to _Mansonella_ or to co-infection with\nother parasites.\n\nMost infections with _M. perstans_ are believed to be asymptomatic. When\nsymptoms occur they appear related to migration of adult worms and include\ntransient subcutaneous swellings (similar to those caused by [_Loa\nloa_](/dpdx/loiasis/index.html)), pericarditis and pleuritis, and ocular\nsymptoms (e.g., impaired visual acuity) if microfilariae enter the eye. Non-\nspecific symptoms including fever, fatigue, pruritus, arthralgias, and\nabdominal pain may occur. Headache and neuropsychiatric symptoms also have\nbeen reported. Signs may include lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia.\n\nIn _M. ozzardi_ , the majority of infections are asymptomatic, although fever,\npruritis, arthralgias, headache, rashes, lymphadenopathy, edema, and pulmonary\nsymptoms are reported; and eosinophilia is common. In Brazil, some infections\nhave been associated with corneal lesions.\n\nLess is known about the clinical manifestations of _M. streptocerca_ ;\nhowever, most infections are believed to be asymptomatic. Pruritis, dermatitis\nand hyperpigmented lesions on the torso are reported in association with _M.\nstreptocerca_ , however, subcutaneous nodules do not occur. As in infections\nwith other _Mansonella_ spp., eosinophilia is common.\n\n",

The tail tapers to a point\nand the nuclei end well before the end of the tail, which is usually bent in a\nsmall hook-like shape. Microfilariae circulate in blood but may be rarely\nfound in the skin, and should be thus distinguished from _Wuchereria\nbancrofti_ and _Onchocerca volvulus._\n\n![](/dpdx/mansonellosis/images/2/M_ozzardi_BAM1.jpg?_=96204)\n\nFigure A: Microfilaria of _M. ozzardi_ in a thick blood smear, stained with\nGiemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/mansonellosis/images/2/M_ozzardi_BAM2.jpg?_=96203)\n\nFigure B: Microfilaria of _M. ozzardi_ in a thick blood smear, stained with\nGiemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/mansonellosis/images/2/M_ozzardi_BAM3.jpg?_=96201)\n\nFigure C: Microfilaria of _M. ozzardi_ in a thick blood smears, stained with\nGiemsa.\n\n![](/dpdx/mansonellosis/images/2/M_ozzardi_BAM4.jpg?_=96205)\n\nFigure D: Microfilaria of _M. ozzardi_ in a thick blood smear, stained with\nGiemsa.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n#### Microscopy\n\n_Mansonella perstans_ and _M. ozzardi_ are usually diagnosed by the finding of\nmicrofilariae circulating in blood whereas _M. streptocerca_ is usually\ndiagnosed by finding microfilariae in skin snips. The rare human cases of _M.\nrodhaini_ were also diagnosed via skin snips. [Concentration\ntechniques](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/blood/specimenproc.html)\n(e.g. Knott’s concentration, polycarbonate membrane filtration) may increase\nsensitivity. Note that these filariae do not generally exhibit periodicity,\nthough in some regions, _M. perstans_ -infected patients may exhibit slightly\nelevated microfilaremia in morning hours.\n\nSkin snips should be thick enough to include the outer part of the dermal\npapillae but not so thick as to produce bleeding (a ~2 mm wide section should\nbe sufficient). Skin snips should be placed immediately in normal saline or\ndistilled water, just enough to cover the specimen. Microfilariae tend to\nemerge more rapidly in saline, however in either medium the microfilariae\ntypically emerge in 30—60 min and can be seen in wet mount preparations. For a\ndefinitive diagnosis, allow the wet mount to dry, fix in methanol, and stain\nwith Giemsa or hematoxylin-and-eosin.\n\n#### Molecular Detection\n\nIn the context of clinical diagnosis, the primary use of _Mansonella_\nmolecular testing is to aid in differentiating microfilariae of _M.\nstreptocerca_ from _Onchocerca volvulus_ in skin snips. In research settings,\nreal-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays can be used to detect and quantify _M. perstans_\nand _M. ozzardi_ microfilariae, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification\nassays (LAMP) have been developed for field use.\n\n#### Serological Testing\n\nSerological assays developed for the detection of _Mansonella_ spp._–_\nspecific antibodies or antigens are generally of limited utility due to cross-\nreactions with other filarial species and potentially other nematodes.\n\n#### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard precautions for the processing of\n[blood](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/blood/safety.html) and tissue samples\napply.\n\n",
