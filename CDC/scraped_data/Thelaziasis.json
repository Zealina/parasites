  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nSpirurid nematodes in the genus _Thelazia_ are primarily veterinary parasites,\nbut may occasionally infect humans. The majority of zoonotic infections\ninvolve _T. callipaeda_ (the Oriental eye worm). _T. californiensis_ (the\nCalifornia eye worm) and _T. gulosa_ (the cattle eyeworm) are less common\ncausative agents.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/thelaziasis/modules/Thelazia_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=92119)](/dpdx/thelaziasis/modules/Thelazia_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/thelaziasis/modules/Thelazia_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nAdults reside in the conjunctival sac of the definitive host where the\novoviviparous females release first-stage (L1) larvae ensheathed in a shell\nmembrane ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . L1 larvae are\ningested by the face fly intermediate host during feeding on tears and\nlacrimal secretions ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . In\nthe digestive tract of the intermediate host, L1 larvae become exsheathed and\ninvade various host tissues, including the hemocoel, fat body, testis, and egg\nfollicles where they develop in capsules. The encapsulated larvae molt twice\nto become infective L3 larvae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The fully developed L3\nlarvae break out of the capsules and migrate to the fly’s mouthparts, where\nthey remain until the fly feeds on the tears of the definitive host. The\nlarvae invade the conjunctival sac of the definitive host upon the fly\nintermediate host’s feeding\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) and become adults after\nabout a month and two additional molts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Humans may also serve as\naberrant definitive hosts following exposure to an infected fly intermediate\nhost in the same manner ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg).\n\n### Hosts and Vectors\n\nBoth wild and domestic canids are considered the primary definitive hosts for\n_Thelazia callipaeda_. Natural infections have also been detected in felids,\nmustelids, and lagomorphs. _T. californiensis_ infections have been reported\nin numerous mammals, mostly from wild and domestic canids, but also others\n(e.g. felids, bears, cervids, sheep, jackrabbits (_Lepus californicus_)). Some\nof these could possibly represent misidentifications of species. _T. gulosa_\nis a parasite of cattle, and occasionally other large ruminants.\n\nIntermediate hosts or vectors for _Thelazia_ spp. are drosophilid flies that\nfeed on lacrimal secretions (lacrimophagous), and associations are parasite-\nspecific. For example, _Phortica_(=_Amiota_)_variegata_ and _P. (=A.) okadai_\nare the primary intermediate hosts for _T. callipaeda_. _Fannia_ spp., such as\n_Fannia benjamini_(canyon fly) and _F. canicularis_(lesser house fly), are\nvectors for _T. californiensis. Musca autumnalis_(face fly) appears to be the\nmost important vector for _T. gulosa._\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Thelazia callipaeda_ is widespread across Asia and has now become established\nin continental Europe. _T. californiensis_ has been reported from the western\nUnited States, although characterization of its range is incomplete. _T.\ngulosa_ has a wide distribution across Asia, Europe, North America, and\nAustralia.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nAdults in the eye cause varying degrees of inflammation and lacrimmation\naccompanied by a foreign body sensation. . In heavier infections, photophobia,\nepiphora, edema, corneal ulceration, and conjunctivitis may occur.\n\n",
