  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Inermicapsifer madagascariensis_(=_cubensis_) (=_arvicanthidis_) infects many\nspecies of rodents, and is rarely found in humans. It is an uncommonly\nencountered and poorly studied zoonotic cestode (family Anoplocephalidae)\ncausing intestinal infections in humans. This species has been the subject of\nhistorical taxonomic debate, especially in regard to its relationship with\n[Raillietina](/dpdx/raillietina/index.html). Invalid names previously\nattributed to _I. madagascariensis_ include “ _Taenia madagascariensis_ ” or “\n_Raillietina madagascariensis”_ _._\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![Inermicapsifer_LifeCycle](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/modules/Inermicapsifer_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=37450)](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/modules/Inermicapsifer_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/modules/Inermicapsifer_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nMotile proglottids containing numerous egg capsules are shed in the definitive\nhost’s feces ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . An unknown\nintermediate host (likely an arthropod) ingests proglottids, or perhaps free\negg capsules released as the proglottid breaks down in the environment\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . Within the intermediate\nhost, oncospheres are released from the eggs and develop into cysticercoids\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The definitive host\nbecomes infected after ingesting intermediate hosts containing cysticercoids\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The unarmed scolex\neverts and anchors to the wall of the small intestine, where maturation to the\nadult stage occurs ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) .\nIncidental human infections are believed to occur when the infected arthropod\nintermediate host is ingested\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\nWhile the majority of _Raillietina_ spp. infect avian definitive hosts, the\nthree confirmed zoonotic species (_R. celebensis, R. demerariensis, R.\nsiriraji_) are natural parasites of rodents and not birds. _R. celebensis_ and\n_R. siriraji_ are primarily found in peridomestic rats (_Rattus norvegicus_\nand _R. rattus_), and also some other Southeast Asian murid rodents. _R.\ndemerariensis_ has been found in various Neotropical rodents and occasionally\nin monkeys.\n\nThe precise identity of the intermediate hosts for the zoonotic _Raillietina_\nspp. are unknown, but several species of ants, ground beetles (family\nCarabidae), scarab beetles (family Scarabaeidae), and darkling beetles (family\nTenebrionidae) serve as intermediate hosts for other _Raillietina_ spp.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Inermicapsifer madagascariensis_ occurs across sub-Saharan Africa (including\nMadagascar and Mauritius), and in Cuba. The synonym “ _I. cubensis_ ” was once\nused to refer to Cuban specimens, which were later shown to be\nindistinguishable from African specimens, suggesting a possible introduction\nto the island. Modern studies on the occurrence of _I. madagascariensis_ are\nscarce.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMost cases are probably asymptomatic, and it is mainly the presence of white,\nmotile proglottids in the stool that prompts clinical attention. Mild\ngastrointestinal disturbances and weight loss that resolves following\ntreatment have been documented in known cases. Nearly all known cases have\nbeen in young children.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "**_Inermicapsifer madagascariensis_****adults and proglottids**\n\nAdult _Inermicapsifer madagascariensis_ measure 24—42 cm long and 3 mm wide\nwith up to about 360 proglottids. The unarmed scolex is small and round with\nfour simple suckers. The unilateral genital pore opens in the middle of the\nlateral margin of the proglottids (versus similar _Raillietina_ spp., which\nopen in the anterior quadrant). Gravid proglottids shed in feces are rounded,\nwhite, and usually motile. They are filled with egg capsules, creating a\n“mosaic” or reticulated appearance when examined microscopically. Egg capsules\nare roughly polygonal with a transparent outer portion and a darker center,\nand contain 4—15 individual eggs.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/images/1/A1.jpg?_=40873)\n\nFigure A: Anterior portion of an adult _I. madagascariensis_ , showing small,\nclub-shaped scolex and trapezoidal, craspedote (overlapping margins) immature\nproglottids.\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/images/1/B1.jpg?_=41056)\n\nFigure B: Scolex of _I. madagascariensis_ (0.45 mm wide). The absence of a\nrostellum and hooks distinguishes this species from the otherwise\nmorphologically-similar _Raillietina_ spp.\n\n![Figure B](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/images/1/C1.jpg?_=41056)\n\nFigure C: Mature proglottids of _I. madagascariensis_. The unilateral genital\npores can sometimes be difficult to distinguish without staining, but may be\nvisible as slight protuberances on the middle of the lateral margin of each\nproglottid (arrows). .\n\n![Figure D](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/images/1/D1.jpg?_=40906)\n\nFigure D: Gravid proglottid of _I. madagascariensis_ (~4 mm long). These are\ntypically barrel-shaped and contain abundant egg capsules, creating a\ndistinctive pattern.

They are\nsimilar in appearance to those of _Raillietina_ spp.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/inermicapsifer/images/2/A2.jpg?_=40980)\n\nFigure A: Single egg capsule freed from gravid proglottid.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of _Inermicapsifer madagascariensis_ is based on the recovery and\nidentification of proglottids, egg capsules, or scolices from the stool.\nGravid proglottids and egg capsules closely resemble those of _Raillietina_\nspp. Careful examination of the genital pore (enhanced by staining) and number\nof eggs within capsules may provide some resolution, but requires\nmorphological expertise and the relevant reproductive features may be obscured\nby the abundant egg capsules in “ripe” proglottids shed in stool. Due to this\nchallenge, the finding of characteristic egg capsules/proglottids in many\ncases is most appropriately reported as “ _Inermicapsifer/Raillietina_ ”, in\nthe absence of the abovementioned identifiable discriminatory features.\n\nThe scolex, while seldom recovered, provides unequivocal distinction between\nthese two cestodes (armed rostellum in _Raillietina;_ unarmed and arostellar\nin _Inermicapsifer_).\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool samples apply. Infectious stages of _I. madagascariensis_\nare not encountered in laboratory diagnostic settings.\n\n",
