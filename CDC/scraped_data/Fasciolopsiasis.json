In the\nsnail the parasites undergo several developmental stages (sporocysts ![The\nnumber 4a](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4a.gif),\nrediae![The number\n4b](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4b.gif), and\ncercariae ![The number\n4c](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4c.gif) ). The\ncercariae are released from the snail ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif) and\nencyst as metacercariae on aquatic plants ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_6.gif). The\nmammalian hosts become infected by ingesting metacercariae on the aquatic\nplants. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum ![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_7.gif)\nand attach to the intestinal wall. There they develop into adult flukes (20 to\n75 mm by 8 to 20 mm) in approximately 3 months, attached to the intestinal\nwall of the mammalian hosts (humans and pigs) ![The number\n8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_8.gif).\nThe adults have a life span of about one year.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nAsia and the Indian subcontinent, especially in areas where humans raise pigs\nand consume freshwater plants.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMost infections are light and asymptomatic. In heavier infections, symptoms\ninclude diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, ascites, anasarca and intestinal\nobstruction.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Fasciolopsis buski_ eggs.\n\nEggs of _Fasciolopsis buski_ are broadly ellipsoidal, operculated and measure\n130-150 µm long by 60-90 µm wide. The eggs are unembryonated when passed in\nfeces. The eggs of _F. buski_ can be difficult to distinguish from _Fasciola\nhepatica_ , although the abopercular end of the latter often has a roughened\nor irregular area.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/1/F_buski_egg_wtmt_BAM1.jpg?_=05064)\n\nFigure A: Egg of _F. buski_ in a unstained wet mount.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/1/F_buski_wtmt400_HB2.jpg?_=05060)\n\nFigure E: Higher magnification (400x) of the egg in Figure D.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/1/F_buski_egg_wtmt_BAM2.jpg?_=05058)\n\nFigure B: Egg of _F. buski_ in a unstained wet mount.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/1/F_buski_egg_wtmt_BAM3.jpg?_=05062)\n\nFigure C: Egg of _F. buski_ in unstained wet mounts.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/1/F_buski_wtmt200_HB1.jpg?_=05057)\n\nFigure D: Egg of _F. buski_ in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n#####  _Fasciolopsis buski_ adults.\n\nAdults of _F. buski_ measure 20-75 mm long and have poorly-developed oral and\nventral suckers. Adults reside in the intestine of the mammalian host.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/2/F_buski_unstained_adult1.jpg?_=05053)\n\nFigure B: Adult fluke of F. buski.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/2/Fasciolopsis_buski_adult_GA.jpg?_=05055)\n\nFigure A: Adult fluke of F. buski. Image contributed by Georgia Division of\nPublic Health.\n\n##### Intermediate hosts of _F. buski_.\n\n_Fasciolopsis buski_ requires a snail intermediate host for completion of its\nlife cycle. The snails used by _F. buski_ are small planorbid snails in the\ngenera _Hippeutis_ and _Segmentina_.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/3/Hippeutis_species_Poppe.jpg?_=05065)\n\nFigure A: Snail in the genus Hippeutis, an intermediate host for _F. buski_.\nImage courtesy of Conchology, Inc, Mactan Island, Philippines.\n\n![](/dpdx/fasciolopsiasis/images/3/Segmentina_species_Poppe.jpg?_=05067)\n\nFigure B: Snail in the genus Segmentina, an intermediate host for _F. buski_.\nImage courtesy of Conchology, Inc, Mactan Island, Philippines.\n\n",
  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs, or more rarely of the adult flukes, in the\nstool or vomitus is the basis of specific diagnosis. The eggs are\nindistinguishable from those of _Fasciola hepatica_.\n\n##### Morphology\n\n[Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n",
