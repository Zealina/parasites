  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\n_Chilomastix mesnili_ is a nonpathogenic flagellate that is often described as\na commensal organism in the human gastrointestinal tract.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/chilomastix/modules/Chilomastix_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=73660)](/dpdx/chilomastix/modules/Chilomastix_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/chilomastix/modules/Chilomastix_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nThe cyst stage is resistant to environmental pressures and is responsible for\ntransmission of _Chilomastix_. Both cysts and trophozoites can be found in the\nfeces (diagnostic stages) ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg)\n. Infection occurs by the ingestion of cysts in contaminated water, food, or\nby the fecal-oral route (hands or fomites)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . In the large (and\npossibly small) intestine, excystation releases trophozoites. _Chilomastix_\nresides in the cecum and/or colon; it is generally considered a commensal\nwhose contribution to pathogenesis is uncertain.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide. It is more prevalent in areas with inadequate sanitation.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\n_Chilomastix mesnili_ is considered nonpathogenic. The presence of cysts\nand/or trophozoites in stool specimens can however be an indicator of fecal\ncontamination of a food or water source, and thus does not rule out other\nparasitic infections.\n\n",

Trophozoites are pear-shaped and usually\nmeasure 6–24 µm in length. The anterior end is rounded and contains a single\nnucleus with an eccentric karyosome. The posterior end tapers off to a point.\n\n![](/dpdx/chilomastix/images/1/C_mesnili_troph_BM1.jpg?_=96217)\n\nFigure A: Trophozoite of _C. mesnili_ from a stool specimen, stained with\ntrichrome.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n_Chilomastix mesnili_ is identified through the detection of cysts and/or\ntrophozoites in stool specimens, both concentrated wet mounts and permanent\nstained smears (e.g., trichrome).\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard precautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool samples apply. While _Chilomastix mesnili_ is non-\npathogenic, care should be taken to avoid other enteric pathogens potentially\nin unfixed stools.\n\n",
