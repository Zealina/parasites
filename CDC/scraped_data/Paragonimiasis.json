  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nMore than 30 species of trematodes (flukes) of the genus _Paragonimus_ have\nbeen reported which infect animals and humans. Among the more than 10 species\nreported to infect humans, the most common is _P. westermani_ , the oriental\nlung fluke.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/paragonimiasis/modules/Paragonimus_LifeCycle.gif?_=04905)\n\nThe eggs are excreted unembryonated in the sputum, or alternately they are\nswallowed and passed with stool ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif). In the\nexternal environment, the eggs become embryonated ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif), and\nmiracidia hatch and seek the first intermediate host, a snail, and penetrate\nits soft tissues ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif).\nMiracidia go through several developmental stages inside the snail ![The\nnumber 4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif):\nsporocysts ![The number\n4a](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4a.gif), rediae\n![The number\n4b](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4b.gif), with\nthe latter giving rise to many cercariae ![The number\n4c](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4c.gif), which\nemerge from the snail. The cercariae invade the second intermediate host, a\ncrustacean such as a crab or crayfish, where they encyst and become\nmetacercariae. This is the infective stage for the mammalian host ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif). Human\ninfection with _P. westermani_ occurs by eating inadequately cooked or pickled\ncrab or crayfish that harbor metacercariae of the parasite ![The number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_6.gif). The\nmetacercariae excyst in the duodenum ![The number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_7.gif),\npenetrate through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, then through\nthe abdominal wall and diaphragm into the lungs, where they become\nencapsulated and develop into adults ![The number\n8](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/lungs_8.gif). (7.5 to 12\nmm by 4 to 6 mm). The worms can also reach other organs and tissues, such as\nthe brain and striated muscles, respectively. However, when this takes place\ncompletion of the life cycles is not achieved, because the eggs laid cannot\nexit these sites. Time from infection to oviposition is 65 to 90 days.\nInfections may persist for 20 years in humans. Animals such as pigs, dogs, and\na variety of feline species can also harbor _P. westermani_.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Paragonimus_ spp. are distributed throughout the Americas, Africa and\nsoutheast Asia. _Paragonimus westermani_ is distributed in southeast Asia and\nJapan. _Paragonimus kellicotti_ is endemic to North America.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe acute phase (invasion and migration) may be marked by diarrhea, abdominal\npain, fever, cough, urticaria, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary abnormalities,\nand eosinophilia. During the chronic phase, pulmonary manifestations include\ncough, expectoration of discolored sputum, hemoptysis, and chest radiographic\nabnormalities. Extrapulmonary locations of the adult worms result in more\nsevere manifestations, especially when the brain is involved.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n#### Morphologic Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is based on microscopic demonstration of eggs in stool or sputum,\nbut these are not present until 2 to 3 months after infection. (Eggs are also\noccasionally encountered in effusion fluid or biopsy material.) Concentration\ntechniques may be necessary in patients with light infections. Biopsy may\nallow diagnostic confirmation and species identification when an adult or\ndeveloping fluke is recovered.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n#### Antibody Detection\n\nPulmonary paragonimiasis is the most common presentation of patients infected\nwith _Paragonimus_ spp., although extrapulmonary (cerebral, abdominal)\nparagonimiasis may occur. Detection of eggs in sputum or feces of patients\nwith paragonimiasis is often very difficult; therefore, serodiagnosis may be\nvery helpful in confirming infections and for monitoring the results of\nindividual chemotherapy. In the United States, detection of antibodies to\n_Paragonimus westermani_ has helped physicians differentiate paragonimiasis\nfrom tuberculosis in Indochinese immigrants. The complement fixation (CF) test\nhas been the standard test for paragonimiasis; it is highly sensitive for\ndiagnosis and for assessing cure after therapy. Because of the technical\ndifficulties of CF, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) tests were developed as a\nreplacement. The immunoblot (IB) assay performed with a crude antigen extract\nof _P. westermani_ has been in use at CDC since 1988. Positive reactions,\nbased on demonstration of an 8-kDa antigen-antibody band were obtained with\nserum samples of 96% of patients with parasitologically confirmed _P.\nwestermani_ infection. Specificity was >99%; of 210 serum specimens from\npatients with other parasitic and non-parasitic infections, only 1 serum\nsample from a patient with _Schistosoma haematobium_ reacted. Antibody levels\ndetected by EIA and IB do decline after chemotherapeutic cure but not as\nrapidly as those detected by the CF test. Most published literature deals with\npulmonary paragonimiasis due to _P. westermani_ although in some geographic\nareas other _Paragonimus_ species cause similar or distinct clinical\nmanifestations in human infections. Cross-reactivity between species does\noccur but at varying levels for different species. Thus, use of a test for _P.\nwestermani_ may not allow detection of antibodies to other _Paragonimus_\nspecies.\n\n##### Reference:\n\nSlemenda SB, Maddison SE, Jong EC, Moore DD.
