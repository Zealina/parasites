  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe trematode  _Dicrocoelium dendriticum_ , the lanceolate fluke or lancet\nfluke, is a common parasite of ruminants but humans can be accidental\ndefinitive hosts. Another species, _D. hospes_ , is responsible for human\ninfections in West Africa.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/dicrocoeliasis/modules/Dicrocoelium_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=09596)](/dpdx/dicrocoeliasis/modules/Dicrocoelium_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/dicrocoeliasis/modules/Dicrocoelium_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nEmbryonated eggs containing miracidia are shed in feces of definitive hosts,\nwhich are typically ruminants\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . The eggs are then\ningested by the first intermediate host (snail)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . When the miracidia hatch\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2a.jpg) , they migrate through\nthe gut wall and settle into the adjacent vascular connective tissue, where\nthey become mother sporocysts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2b.jpg) . The sporocysts migrate\nto the digestive gland where they give rise to several daughter sporocysts.\nInside each daughter sporocyst, cercariae are produced\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2c.jpg) . Cercariae migrate to\nthe respiration chamber where they are shed in slime ball from the snail\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . After a slime ball is\ningested by the second intermediate host (ant), the cercariae become free in\nthe intestine and migrate to the hemocoel where they become metacercariae\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . When the infected ant is\neaten by a suitable definitive host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) , the metacercariae excyst\nin the small intestine. The worms migrate to the bile duct where they mature\ninto adults ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . Humans can\nserve as definitive hosts after ingesting infected ants (e.g. on contaminated\nfood items) ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\nRuminants, especially cattle and sheep, are the normal definitive hosts of\n_Dicrocoelium_ spp. Apart from humans, aberrant infections have been\nidentified in various non-human primate species and domestic dogs.\n\nFirst intermediate hosts include a wide variety of air-breathing land snail\nspecies, such as those in the genera _Cochlicopa_ (=_Cionella_)_, Helix,\nXerolenta_(_=Helicella_), and _Zebrina._ Many different types of ants can\nserve as second intermediate hosts, especially members of the genus _Formica_.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Dicrocoelium dendriticum_ is present in definitive hosts throughout Europe,\nAsia, and North Africa, and can be found sporadically in North America. Most\nof the known clinical cases have occurred in North Africa and the Middle East.\n_D. hospes_ is endemic in sub-Saharan West Africa; cases have been documented\nin Ghana, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Mali.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMost infections involve low numbers of flukes and are not associated with\novert symptoms. In more intense infections, symptoms may include\ncholecystitis, liver abscesses, and generalized gastrointestinal/abdominal\ndistress. Occasional cases involving flukes in subcutaneous masses have been\nreported.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### **_Dicrocoelium dendriticum_ eggs in wet mounts.**\n\nEggs of _Dicrocoelium dendriticum_ are operculated and measure 35-45 µm long\nby 20-30 µm wide. The eggs are thick-shelled and usually dark brown in color.\nEggs are fully embryonated when shed in feces.\n\n![](/dpdx/dicrocoeliasis/images/1/D_dendriticum_egg_wtmt_JCG_B.jpg?_=01641)\n\nFigure A: Egg of _Dicrocoelium dendriticum_ in an unstained wet mount of\nstool.

The paired testes lie just behind the anteriorly-located\nventral sucker (acetabulum). The ovary is small and located behind the testes.\nAdults reside in the bile ducts of the definitive host.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/dicrocoeliasis/images/2/dicro.jpg?_=13881)\n\nFigure A: Adult of D. dendriticum, stained with carmine. Structures\nillustrated in this figure include: oral sucker (OS), acetabulum (AC), uterus\n(UT), testes (TE), and vitelline glands (VT).\n\n**Intermediate hosts of _Dicrocoelium_ spp.**\n\nLike all trematodes, _Dicrocoelium_ spp. requires a snail as a first\nintermediate host. Over 50 species of land snail may serve as the first\nintermediate host. The second intermediate host is an ant, usually in the\ngenus _Formica_ , although other genera may serve as a host.\n\n![](/dpdx/dicrocoeliasis/images/3/Zebrina_Conchology_A.jpg?_=01643)\n\nFigure A: Zebrina detrita, a common first intermediate host for D.\ndendriticum.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is based on microscopic identification of eggs in the stool,\nduodenal, and/or bile fluid. Note that eggs may be detected in stool following\nconsumption of liver infected with adult flukes; additional specimens should\nbe collected to distinguish this spurious passage from a true infection. Adult\nflukes are rarely recovered.\n\nMore on: [Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard protocols](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the\nprocessing of stool specimens apply. _Dicrocoelium_ spp. eggs are not\ninfectious to humans.\n\n",
