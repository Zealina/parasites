  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe two species of bed bugs (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cimicidae) usually implicated\nin human infestations are _Cimex lectularius_ and _C. hemipterus_. Although\nrare, humans may become incidental hosts of _Cimex_ species of bats and birds.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![lifecycle](/dpdx/bedbugs/modules/Bed_Bug_LifeCycle.gif?_=04629)\n\nAdults and all nymphal stages of _Cimex_ spp. need to take blood meals from\nwarm-blooded hosts, which are typically humans for _C. lectularius_ and _C.\nhemipterus_ , although other mammals and birds can be utilized in the absence\nof a human host. Female bed bugs lay about five eggs ![The Number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif) daily\nthroughout their adult lives in a sheltered location (mattress seams, crevices\nin box springs, spaces under baseboards, etc). Eggs hatch in about 4-12 days\ninto first instar nymphs ![The Number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif) which\nmust take a blood meal before molting to the next stage. The bugs will undergo\nfive nymphal stages (![The Number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif), ![The\nNumber 3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif),\n![The Number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif), ![The\nNumber 5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_5.gif),\n![The Number\n6](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_6.gif) ), each\none requiring a blood meal before molting to the next stage, with the fifth\nstage molting into an adult ![The Number\n7](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_7.gif). Nymphs,\nalthough lacking wing buds, resemble smaller versions of the adults. Nymphs\nand adults take about 5-10 minutes to obtain a full blood meal. The adults may\ntake several blood meals over several weeks, assuming a warm-blooded host is\navailable. Mating occurs off the host and involves a unique form of copulation\ncalled ‘traumatic insemination’ whereby the male penetrates the female’s\nabdominal wall with his external genitalia and inseminates into her body\ncavity. Adults live 6-12 months and may survive for long periods of time\nwithout feeding.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Cimex lectularius_ is cosmopolitan in distribution; _C. hemipterus_ is\ndistributed in the tropics and sub-tropics\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nAlthough bed bugs have been found naturally-infected with blood-borne\npathogens, they are not effective vectors of disease. The primary medical\nimportance is inflammation associated with their bites (due to allergic\nreactions to components in their saliva)\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### _Cimex lectularius._\n\nThe two most common species of bed bugs implicated in human infestations are\n_Cimex lectularius_ and _C. hemipterus_ ; the former of which is cosmopolitan,\nand the latter being found mostly in the tropics and sub-tropics. Adults are\non average 5 mm long, oval-shaped and dorso-ventrally flattened. Like other\nmembers of the order, Hemiptera, they possess piercing-sucking mouthparts.\nAdults are brachypterous; the hindwings are nearly absent and the forewings\nare reduced to small, leathery pads. Nymphs look like smaller, paler versions\nof the adults. While _Cimex_ spp. have been found to be naturally-infected\nwith several blood-borne pathogens, they are not effective vectors of disease.\nThe primary medical importance is inflammation associated with their bites.\n\n![](/dpdx/bedbugs/images/1/C_lectularius_trio_BAM.jpg?_=04640)\n\nFigure A: Two adults and one nymph (arrow) of _C. lectularius_ , collected in\na hotel in urban Georgia.\n\n![](/dpdx/bedbugs/images/1/C_lectularius_mouthparts_Bam.jpg?_=04642)\n\nFigure E: Higher magnification of the specimen in Figure D, showing a close-up\nof the typical hemipteran piercing-sucking mouthparts (arrow).\n\n![](/dpdx/bedbugs/images/1/C_lectularius_dorsal_BAM.jpg?_=04646)\n\nFigure B: Close-up of one of the adults in Figure A.\n\n![](/dpdx/bedbugs/images/1/C_lectularius_nymph_BAM.jpg?_=04636)\n\nFigure E: Nymph of _C. lectularius_.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nThe inflammatory reaction to the bites is not diagnostic specifically for bed\nbugs, and confirmation of a bed bug bite or infestation is best achieved by\nidentification of adults or nymphs collected in sheltered areas near where the\npatient was bitten. Bed bugs possess stink glands and emit a distinctive odor;\nhomes or motel/hotel rooms with heavy infestations may have this odor.\n\n",
