  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nIntestinal hookworm disease in humans is caused by _Ancylostoma duodenale,_\n_A. ceylanicum,_ and _Necator americanus._ Classically, _A. duodenale_ and _N.\namericanus_ were considered the two primary intestinal hookworm species\nworldwide, but newer studies show that a parasite infecting animals, _A.\nceylanicum_ , is also an important emerging parasite infecting humans in some\nregions. Occasionally larvae of _A. caninum_ , normally a parasite of canids,\nmay partially develop in the human intestine and cause eosinophilic enteritis,\nbut this species does not appear to reach reproductive maturity in humans.\n\nAnother group of hookworms infecting animals can penetrate the human skin\ncausing cutaneous larva migrans (_A. braziliense_ , _A. caninum_ , _Uncinaria\nstenocephala_). Other than _A. caninum_ noted above, these parasites do not\ndevelop further after their larvae penetrate human skin. See [extraintestinal\nhookworms](/dpdx/zoonotichookworm/index.html) for more information.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/hookworm/modules/Hookworm_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=81699)](/dpdx/hookworm/modules/Hookworm_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/hookworm/modules/Hookworm_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nEggs are passed in the stool\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) , and under favorable\nconditions (moisture, warmth, shade), larvae hatch in 1 to 2 days and become\nfree-living in contaminated soil. These released rhabditiform larvae grow in\nthe feces and/or the soil ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg)\n, and after 5 to 10 days (and two molts) they become filariform (third-stage)\nlarvae that are infective ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg)\n. These infective larvae can survive 3 to 4 weeks in favorable environmental\nconditions. On contact with the human host, typically bare feet, the larvae\npenetrate the skin and are carried through the blood vessels to the heart and\nthen to the lungs. They penetrate into the pulmonary alveoli, ascend the\nbronchial tree to the pharynx, and are swallowed\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The larvae reach the\njejunum of the small intestine, where they reside and mature into adults.\nAdult worms live in the lumen of the small intestine, typically the distal\njejunum, where they attach to the intestinal wall with resultant blood loss by\nthe host ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Most adult\nworms are eliminated in 1 to 2 years, but the longevity may reach several\nyears.\n\nSome _A. duodenale_ larvae, following penetration of the host skin, can become\ndormant (hypobiosis in the intestine or muscle). These larvae are capable of\nre-activating and establishing patent, intestinal infections. In addition,\ninfection by _A. duodenale_ may probably also occur by the oral and the\ntransmammary route. _A. ceylanicum_ and _A. caninum_ infections may also be\nacquired by oral ingestion. _A. caninum-_ associated eosinophilic enteritis is\nbelieved to result following oral ingestion of larvae, not percutaneous\ninfection. _N. americanus_ does not appear to be infective via the oral or\ntransmammary route.\n\n### Hosts\n\nHumans are the principal host for both _A. duodenale_ and _N. americanus._ _A.\nceylanicum_ may be zoonotic, as two haplotypes have been identified, one found\nonly in humans thus far and the other found in humans, dogs, and cats. _A.\ncaninum_ is the common dog hookworm.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nHookworm species have a worldwide distribution, mostly in areas with moist,\nwarm climates where larvae can survive in the environment. Both _Necator\namericanus_ and _Ancylostoma duodenale_ are found in Africa, Asia, Australia\nand the Americas. Only _N. americanus_ is found in south India and\npredominates in the Americas, while only _A. duodenale_ is found in the Middle\nEast, North Africa, and northern India.\n\n_A. ceylanicum_ is highly endemic throughout much of Southeast Asia and the\nPacific Islands, and also has been reported from Australia, Japan, South\nAfrica, Madagascar, Suriname, Guyana, and the UAE; it appears to be absent\nfrom Europe and North America. However, the full extent of its geographic\noccurrence is not completely characterized.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nIntestinal hookworm infections are commonly asymptomatic. Attachment of the\nhookworms to the intestinal wall may stimulate abdominal pain, nausea, and\nanorexia. Iron deficiency anemia caused by blood loss at the site of\nintestinal attachment of adult worms may occur especially in heavy infections.\nOccult blood in the stool may also be seen in heavy infections. In severe\ncases, protein malnutrition from chronic plasma protein loss has been\nreported.\n\nOther clinical manifestations of hookworm infection include an urticarial\ndermal reaction (“ground itch”) associated with filariform (L3) larvae\npenetration, and respiratory involvement including eosinophilic pneumonia may\nbe observed may occur during larval pulmonary migration A second urticarial\nrash may subsequently develop during pulmonary migration. Patients have\nreported vague gastrointestinal disturbances and eosinophilia (sometimes\nreferred to as Wakana syndrome) following peroral infection.\n\n",

They have a long buccal canal and an\ninconspicuous genital primordium. Rhabditiform larvae are usually not found in\nstool, but may be found there is a delay in processing the stool specimen. If\nlarvae are seen in stool, they must be differentiated from the L1 larvae of\n_Strongyloides stercoralis_.\n\n![](/dpdx/hookworm/images/2/Hookworm_rhabditiform.jpg?_=02477)\n\nFigure A: Hookworm rhabditiform larva (wet preparation).\n\n![](/dpdx/hookworm/images/2/Hookworm_rhabditiform_2.jpg?_=02475)\n\nFigure B: Hookworm rhabditiform larva (wet preparation).\n\n##### **Hookworm filariform larvae.**\n\nInfective, third-stage (L3), filariform larvae are 500—700 µm long. They have\na pointed tail and are ensheathed, with about a 1:2 ratio in length of\nesophagus to intestine. Some subtle morphological differences exist between\n_A. duodenale_ and _N. americanus_ at this stage.

Males\nare bursate, with two spicules that are fused at the distal end in _Necator_\nspp. but not in _Ancylostoma_ spp. Adults of both sexes have a buccal capsule\ncontaining sharp teeth (_Ancylostoma_) or cutting plates _(Necator_).\n\n![](/dpdx/hookworm/images/4/Aduodenale_head_A.jpg?_=02473)\n\nFigure A: Adult worm of _Ancylostoma duodenale_.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs in the stool is the most common method for\ndiagnosing hookworm infection. The recommended procedure is as follows:\n\n  1. Collect a stool specimen.\n  2. Fix the specimen in formalin.\n  3. Concentrate using the formalin–ethyl acetate sedimentation technique.\n  4. Examine a wet mount of the sediment.\n\nWhere concentration procedures are not available, a direct wet mount\nexamination of the specimen is adequate for detecting moderate to heavy\ninfections. For quantitative assessments of infection, various methods such as\nthe Kato-Katz, FLOTAC and Mini-FLOTAC may be used.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard protocols](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) apply for\nthe handling of stool specimens. Appropriate PPE (gloves, gown) should always\nbe worn to minimize the risk of transdermal penetration when working with\nstool specimens or larval cultures. _In vitro_ exposure to 70% ethanol has\nbeen shown to kill 95.6% of 45 infective _N. americanus_ larvae within five\nminutes and to kill all such larvae within 10 minutes, making ethanol a\nsuitable surface disinfectant. Lugol’s iodine (1% povidine iodine; 10,000 ppm)\nmay be used to kill hookworm larvae on exposed skin.\n\n",
