  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nToxocariasis in humans is caused by infection with larvae of _Toxocara_ spp.,\nwhich are common ascarid roundworms of mammals. Confirmed zoonotic species\ninclude the dog roundworm _T. canis_(presumed most common) and the cat\nroundworm _T. cati_(frequency not known). It is not known whether other\nclosely-related _Toxocara_ species can infect humans (e.g. _T. malaysiensis_\nof cats).\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/toxocariasis/modules/Toxocara_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=93621)](/dpdx/toxocariasis/modules/Toxocara_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/toxocariasis/modules/Toxocara_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n_Toxocara_ spp. can follow a direct (one host) or indirect (multiple host)\nlife cycle. Unembryonated eggs are shed in the feces of the definitive host\n(canids: _T. canis;_ felids: _T. cati_)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Eggs embryonate over a\nperiod of 1 to 4 weeks in the environment and become infective, containing\nthird-stage (L3) larvae ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) .\nFollowing ingestion by a definitive host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) , the infective eggs hatch\nand larvae penetrate the gut wall. In younger dogs (_T. canis_) and in cats\n(_T. cati_), the larvae migrate through the lungs, bronchial tree, and\nesophagus, where they are coughed up swallowed into the gastrointestinal\ntract; adult worms develop and oviposit in the small intestine\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . In older dogs, patent\n(egg-producing) infections can also occur, but larvae more commonly become\narrested in tissues. Arrested larvae are reactivated in female dogs during\nlate gestation and may infect pups by the transplacental (major) and\ntransmammary (minor) routes\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) in whose small intestine\nadult worms become established\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . In cats, _T. cati_\nlarvae can be transmitted via the transmammary route\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) to kittens if the dam is\ninfected during gestation, but somatic larval arrest and reactivation does not\nappear to be important as in _T. canis_.  \n  \n_Toxocara_ spp. can also be transmitted indirectly through ingestion of\nparatenic hosts. Eggs ingested by suitable paratenic hosts hatch and larvae\npenetrate the gut wall and migrate into various tissues where they encyst\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . The life cycle is\ncompleted when definitive hosts consume larvae within paratenic host tissue\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) , and the larvae develop\ninto adult worms in the small intestine.  \n  \nHumans are accidental hosts who become infected by ingesting infective eggs\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) or undercooked\nmeat/viscera of infected paratenic hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/10.jpg) . After ingestion, the\neggs hatch and larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and are carried by the\ncirculation to a variety of tissues (liver, heart, lungs, brain, muscle, eyes)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/11.jpg) . While the larvae do not\nundergo any further development in these sites, they can cause local reactions\nand mechanical damage that causes clinical toxocariasis.  \n\n### Hosts\n\n_Toxocara canis_ infects essentially all wild and domestic canids; patent\ninfections are more prevalent among puppies than older dogs._T. cati_ is found\nin wild and domestic felids of all ages, but patent infections are slightly\nmore common in kittens.\n\nParatenic host ranges for both species encompass numerous species of mammals\nand birds. Livestock are important paratenic hosts; some human cases have been\nlinked to consumption of undercooked beef, lamb, chicken, and duck meat\n(particularly liver). Cockroaches and earthworms have been experimentally\ninfected, and could possibly serve as paratenic or transport hosts.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Toxocara canis_ and _T. cati_ are cosmopolitan parasites of domestic dogs and\ncats. While common globally, prevalence in both animals and people is highest\nin developing countries. In developed countries, more infections are detected\namong persons in lower socioeconomic strata.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe main clinical presentations of toxocariasis are visceral larva migrans\n(VLM) and ocular larva migrans (OLM), although most infections are\nasymptomatic. In VLM, which occurs mostly in preschool children, the larvae\ninvade multiple tissues (commonly liver, lung, skeletal muscle, occasionally\nheart) and cause various nonspecific symptoms (e.g. fever, myalgia, weight\nloss, cough, rashes, hepatosplenomegaly) usually accompanied by\nhypereosinophilia.\n\nMigration to the central nervous system (neurotoxocariasis or neural larva\nmigrans (NLM)) is uncommon and can cause eosinophilic meningoencephalitis.\nDeath can occur in instances of severe cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic\ninvolvement.\n\nIn OLM, the larvae produce various ophthalmologic lesions, and may cause\ndiffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN). Involvement is typically\nunilateral (affecting one eye) and associated visual impairment usually\npresents with uveitis, retinitis, or endophthalmitis; permanent visual damage\nor blindness can occur. Associated larval granulomas have in some cases have\nbeen misdiagnosed as retinoblastoma. OLM most often occurs in older children\nor young adults, who uncommonly have visceral manifestations.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### **_Toxocara_ sp. eggs.**\n\nEggs are not clinically diagnostic for human cases as humans are incapable of\nharboring adult worms that pass eggs. Humans are paratenic hosts for\n_Toxocara_ spp. and eggs are found only in the feces of definitive hosts (cats\nand dogs). _Toxocara_ eggs are golden in color, spherical to slightly pear\nshaped, thick-shelled, and have a pitted surface. The size range for different\nspecies varies slightly; _T. canis_ is slightly larger (80—85 µm) than _T.\ncati_ (65—75 µm). _Toxocara_ sp. eggs are extremely hardy and can persist in\nthe environment for years.\n\n![](/dpdx/toxocariasis/images/1/Toxocara_egg_wtmt.jpg?_=96676)\n\nFigure A: _Toxocara_ sp. egg teased from an adult worm.

Two large excretory\ncolumns are present and single-pointed lateral alae are conspicuous along most\nof the body length. Their overall appearance is very similar to but smaller\nthan _Baylisascaris procyonis_ (which is typically 45—65 µm in width).\n\n![](/dpdx/toxocariasis/images/4/Toxocara_larvae_he.jpg?_=96684)\n\nFigure A: Cross-section of _Toxocara_ sp. larvae in liver tissue stained with\nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\n\n![](/dpdx/toxocariasis/images/4/Toxocara_larva2_he.jpg?_=96686)\n\nFigure B: Longitudinal section of a _Toxocara_ sp. larva in liver tissue\nstained with H&E.\n\n![](/dpdx/toxocariasis/images/4/Toxocara_larva3_he.jpg?_=96685)\n\nFigure C: Longitudinal section of a _Toxocara_ sp. larva in lung tissue\nstained with H&E.\n\n![](/dpdx/toxocariasis/images/4/Toxo_canis_liver.jpg?_=00010)\n\nFigure D. _Toxocara canis_ longitudinal section (arrow) in the liver of an\ninfected monkey.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of toxocariasis relies mostly on indirect means, particularly\nserology, since larvae are trapped in tissues and not readily detected\nmorphologically. While visualization of larvae in histologic sections provides\nunequivocal diagnosis, the probability of capturing a larva in a small biopsy\nspecimen is low. Since the larvae do not develop into adults in humans, a\nstool examination would not detect any _Toxocara_ eggs. For both VLM and OLM,\na presumptive diagnosis rests on clinical signs, compatible exposure history\n(e.g. history of exposure to puppies/kittens or pica/geophagia behaviors),\nlaboratory findings (including eosinophilia), and the detection of antibodies\nto _Toxocara_.\n\n#### Antibody Detection\n\nAntibody detection tests are the only means of confirmation of a clinical\ndiagnosis of visceral larva migrans (VLM) and ocular larva migrans (OLM),\nclinical syndromes associated with _Toxocara_ infections. The currently\nrecommended serologic test for toxocariasis is enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with\nlarval stage antigens extracted from embryonated eggs or released in vitro by\ncultured third-stage larvae. The latter, _Toxocara_ excretory-secretory (TES)\nantigens, are preferable to larval extracts because they are convenient to\nproduce and an absorption-purification step is not required for obtaining\nmaximum specificity.\n\nThe TES-ELISA used at CDC measures total _Toxocara-_ specific immunoglobulin\nand results are reported as an endpoint titer (<1:2, 1:2, 1:4, 1:16, etc.). A\ntiter of ≥1:32 is considered positive. Evaluation of this assay in groups of\npatients with presumptive diagnoses of VLM or OLM indicated sensitivity of 78%\nand 73%, respectively, at a titer of ≥1:32. . Further confirmation of\nserologic diagnosis of OLM can be obtained by testing aqueous or vitreous\nhumor samples for antibodies. Specificity has been reported to be 92% (VLM)\nand 91% (OLM) at a titer of ≥1:32 (serum).\n\nSpecial considerations:\n\n  * The assay detects infections caused by both _T. canis_ and _T. cati_ but cannot differentiate between the two.\n  * Evaluation of the true sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests for toxocariasis in human populations is not possible because of the lack of feasible parasitological methods to detect migrating _Toxocara_ larvae in tissue. These inherent problems result in underestimations of sensitivity and specificity.\n  * When interpreting serologic findings, clinicians must be aware that a measurable titer does not necessarily indicate current clinical _Toxocara_ infection. In most human populations, a small number of those tested have positive EIA titers that apparently reflect the prevalence of asymptomatic toxocariasis, or past infections that have since been cleared. Positive serological results should always be interpreted with consideration of the patient’s clinical picture. Paired serum samples demonstrating a significant rise in antibody level over time may be useful to confirm active infection.\n\n#### Laboratory safety\n\nStandard precautions for the examination of histological sections or\nprocessing of [serum\nsamples](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/serum/submission.html) apply.\n\n",
