  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nMembers of the genus _Bertiella_ are cestodes (tapeworms) of non-human\nprimates in nature. Human infections are uncommon . _B. studeri_ and _B.\nmucronata_ have been identified in children with some contact or association\nwith non-human primates; a few cases may have been related to contaminated\nfruits. There has been some suggestion that _B. studeri_ is a species complex\nbased on reported morphological variance among human cases.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/bertiella/modules/Bertiella_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=55575)](/dpdx/bertiella/modules/Bertiella_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/bertiella/modules/Bertiella_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nAlthough the life cycles of _Bertiella_ species are not completely understood,\nit is generally believed the genus undergoes a two-host life cycle, with an\narthropod intermediate host (usually a mite) and a vertebrate definitive host\n(usually non-human primates for the species implicated in human infection).\nEggs and proglottids are passed in the feces of the definitive host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . Oncospheres are ingested\nby the arthropod intermediate host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . In the arthropod\nintermediate host, the oncospheres develop into cysticercoids\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . The definitive hosts\nbecome infected after ingesting arthropod intermediate hosts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) infected with\ncysticercoids. The cysticercoid everts an unarmed scolex\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) , which it uses to attach\nto the small intestinal wall. Adults remain in the small intestine of the host\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . Although rare, humans\nmay also serve as incidental definitive hosts for _Bertiella_ spp., usually\nafter accidentally ingesting infected mites\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\n_Bertiella studeri_ usually infects monkeys in the genera _Anthropopithecus,\nCercopithecus, Cynomologus_ and _Macaca; B. mucronata_ has been recovered from\nmonkeys in the genera _Callicebus_ and _Alouatta_. Apes such as chimpanzees\n_(Pan_ spp._)_ may also be infected, often in captive settings. Intermediate\nhosts are believed to be one or several species of orobatid mites.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Bertiella mucronata_ is a New World species known to occur in South America\nand Cuba; _B. studeri_ is an Old World species found in Africa and Asia.\nImported cases have been recorded in non-endemic areas. Most human cases of\nbertiellosis occur in persons who have had contact with primates.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nWith so few human cases reported, clinical aspects of this infection are not\nwell defined. Many of the reported cases have been asymptomatic; however, some\npatients have reported gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "##### Eggs of _Bertiella_ spp.\n\nEggs of _B. studeri_ are spherical and measure approximately 35-51 micrometers\nin diameter. Eggs of _B. mucronata_ are smaller than those of _B. studeri_.\nEggs of _Bertiella_ spp. have a characteristic pyriform apparatus, an inner\nchitinous membrane that has a pair of filamentous projections around a six-\nhooked embryo.\n\n![](/dpdx/bertiella/images/1/Bertiella_egg_Clinipath_A.jpg?_=05701)\n\nFigure A: Eggs of _Bertiella_ sp. liberated from proglottids.

The scolex of both species has a\nrudimentary unarmed rostellum and four oval suckers. Mature proglottids are\nsimilar in the two species but can be separated based on the structure of the\nvagina.\n\n![](/dpdx/bertiella/images/2/Bstuderiscolex_Bradbury.jpg?_=05708)\n\nFigure A: Scolex of _Bertiella_ studeri.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is made by the finding of proglottids or, less commonly, eggs in\nstool. The eggs are characteristic and can be liberated from gravid\nproglottids.\n\n### Laboratory Safety\n\n[Standard laboratory\nprecautions](/dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/stool/safety.html) for the processing\nof stool samples apply. Eggs of _Bertiella_ spp. are not infectious to humans.\n\n",
