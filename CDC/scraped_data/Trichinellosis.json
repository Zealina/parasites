  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nTrichinellosis (trichinosis) is caused by nematodes (roundworms) of the genus\n_Trichinella_. In addition to the classical agent _T. spiralis_ (found\nworldwide in many carnivorous and omnivorous animals), several other species\nof _Trichinella_ are now recognized, including _T. pseudospiralis_ (mammals\nand birds worldwide), _T. nativa_ (Arctic bears), _T. nelsoni_ (African\npredators and scavengers), _T. britovi_ (carnivores of Europe and western\nAsia), and _T. papuae_ (wild and domestic pigs, Papua New Guinea and\nThailand). _Trichinella zimbabwensis_ is found in crocodiles in Africa but to\ndate there are no known associations of this species with human disease.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/trichinellosis/modules/Trichinella_LifeCycle.gif?_=00659)\n\nDepending on the classification used, there are several species of\n_Trichinella_ : _T. spiralis_ , _T. pseudospiralis_ , _T. nativa_ , _T.\nmurelli_ , _T. nelsoni_ , _T. britovi_ , _T. papuae_ , and _T. zimbabwensis_ ,\nall but the last of which have been implicated in human disease. Adult worms\nand encysted larvae develop within a single vertebrate host, and an infected\nanimal serves as a definitive host and potential intermediate host. A second\nhost is required to perpetuate the life cycle of _Trichinella_. The domestic\ncycle most often involved pigs and anthropophilic rodents, but other domestic\nanimals such as horses can be involved. In the sylvatic cycle, the range of\ninfected animals is great, but animals most often associated as sources of\nhuman infection are bear, moose and wild boar.\n\nTrichinellosis is caused by the ingestion of undercooked meat containing\nencysted larvae (except for _T. pseudospiralis_ and _T. papuae_ , which do not\nencyst) of _Trichinella_ species ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/stomach_1.gif). After\nexposure to gastric acid and pepsin, the larvae are released from the cysts\n![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_2.gif)\nand invade the small bowel mucosa where they develop into adult worms ![The\nnumber\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_3.gif).\nFemales are 2.2 mm in length; males 1.2 mm. The life span in the small bowel\nis about four weeks. After 1 week, the females release larvae ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_4.gif)\nthat migrate to striated muscles where they encyst ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/bottom_of_diaphram_5.gif).\nDiagnosis is usually made based on clinical symptoms, and is confirmed by\nserology or identification of encysted or non-encysted larvae in biopsy or\nautopsy specimens.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide. Most common in parts of Europe and the United States.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nLight infections may be asymptomatic. Intestinal invasion can be accompanied\nby gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting). Larval\nmigration into muscle tissues (one week after infection) can cause periorbital\nand facial edema, conjunctivitis, fever, myalgias, splinter hemorrhages,\nrashes, and peripheral eosinophilia. Occasional life-threatening\nmanifestations include myocarditis, central nervous system involvement, and\npneumonitis. Larval encystment in the muscles causes myalgia and weakness,\nfollowed by subsidence of symptoms.\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nThe suspicion of trichinellosis (trichinosis), based on history, clinical\nsymptoms, and eosinophilia, can be confirmed by specific diagnostic tests,\nincluding antibody detection, muscle biopsy, and microscopy.\n\n#### Antibody Detection\n\nImmunodiagnostic tests currently available in the U.S. include enzyme\nimmunoassays (EIA) that detect _Trichinella_ -specific antibodies. EIAs\nutilize antigen preparations that may be crude extracts prepared from\nhomogenates of _T. spiralis_ muscle larvae or excretory-secretory (ES)\nproducts produced by cultured larvae. The TSL-1 group of larval secretory\nantigens are conserved in all species/isolates of _Trichinella_ and thus can\nbe used to detect infection in animals or people infected with any of the\ntypes of _Trichinella_ currently recognized. Positive reactions are detectable\nat some time during infection in serum samples of 80% to 100% of patients with\nclinically symptomatic trichinellosis (trichinosis). Antibody levels are often\nnot detectable until 3 to 5 weeks post-infection, well after the onset of\nacute-stage illness. Antibody development is also affected by the infecting\ndose of larvae: the higher the infecting dose, the faster the patientâ€™s\nantibody response will develop. Multiple serum specimens should be drawn\nseveral weeks apart to demonstrate seroconversion in patients whose initial\nspecimen was negative. IgG, IgM, and IgE antibodies are detectable in many\npatients; however, tests based on IgG antibodies are most sensitive. Antibody\nlevels peak in the second or third month post-infection and then decline\nslowly for several years. In our experience at CDC, EIAs with ES antigens\ndetect antibodies earlier than bentonite flocculation (BF) in 25% of serum\nspecimens from patients with acute infection, but EIAs also remain positive\nfor longer periods after infection than the BF, and are reactive in a larger\nproportion of persons with no clinical evidence of trichinellosis.\n\n#### Reference:\n\nMurrell KD, Bruschi F.
