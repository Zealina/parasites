  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nMany species of fleas can feed on humans. The human flea, _Pulex irritans_ ,\nis less-commonly seen these in industrialized areas. This species is not an\neffective vector of disease but can serve as an intermediate host for the\ncestodes [_Dipylidium\ncaninum_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/dipylidium/index.html) and [_Hymenolepis\nnana_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/hymenolepiasis/index.html). The cat and dog\nfleas (_Ctenocephalides canis_ and _C. felis_) may also feed on humans. In\naddition to being intermediate hosts for cestodes, _C. felis_ can serve as a\nvector of _Bartonella henselae_ (cat-scratch disease) and _Rickettsia felis_\n(feline rickettsiae). The Oriental rat flea (_Xenopsylla cheopis_) is the\nprimary vector for _Yersinia pestis_ (plague). Humans with close contact with\nbirds may also be fed upon by the sticktight flea (_Echidnophaga gallinacea_).\nThe chigo flea (_Tunga penetrans_) is discussed separately\n[here](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/tungiasis/index.html).\n\n### General Flea Life Cycle\n\n![lifeCycle](/dpdx/fleas/modules/FleasLifeCycle.gif?_=01918)\n\nFleas, like other holometabolous insects, have a four-part life cycle\nconsisting of eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. Eggs are shed by the female in\nthe enviroment ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_1.gif). Eggs\nhatch into larvae ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif) in about\n3-4 days and feed on organic debris in the environment. The number of larval\ninstars varies among the species. Larvae eventually form pupae ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif), which\nare in cocoons that are often covered with debris from the environment (sand,\npebbles, etc). The larval and pupal stages take about 3-4 weeks to complete.\nAfterwards, adults hatch from pupae ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif) and seek\nout a warm-blooded host for blood meals. The primary hosts for\n_Ctenocephalides felis_ and _C. canis_ are cats and dogs, respectively,\nalthough other mammals, including humans, may be fed upon. The primary hosts\nfor _Xenopsylla cheopis_ are rodents, especially rats. In North America,\nplague (_Yersinia pestis_) is cycled between _X. cheopis_ and prairie dogs.\nHumans are the primary host for _Pulex irritans._\n\nThe chigoe flea (_Tunga penetrans_) has different life cycle and is discussed\nin more detail [here](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/tungiasis/index.html).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Ctenocephalides canis_ and _C. felis._  \n\n_Ctenocephalides canis_ and _C. felis_ are the dog and cat flea, respectively.\nMembers of this genus are 3-4 mm in length, laterally-compressed and reddish-\nbrown to black in color. The two species can be separated by the\ncharacteristics of the head and setae on the hind legs: _C. canis_ has a head\nthat is strongly-rounded anteriorly, and have hind tibiae with eight setae\nbearing notches; _C. felis_ has a more-elongate head and hind tibiae with six\nsetae bearing notches. Both species possess pronotal and genal combs\n(ctenidia). _Ctenocephalides_ spp. are of medical importance as vectors of\nrickettsial diseases, including _Rickettsia typhi_ , and may serve as\nintermediate hosts for tapeworms, including\n[_Hymenolepis_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/hymenolepiasis/index.html) and\n[_Dipylidium_](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/dipylidium/index.html).\n\n![](/dpdx/fleas/images/1/C_felis_PADIL1.jpg?_=01929)\n\nFigure A: The cat flea, _C. felis_.

They lack both genal and pronotal combs (ctenidia) and\nthe ocular setae are below the eye. The frons is broadly-rounded. This species\nis not an efficient vector of any flea-borne diseases, but its bite can cause\nallergic reactions due to salivary proteins.\n\n![](/dpdx/fleas/images/2/Pirritans_habitus_PADIL.jpg?_=01934)\n\nFigure A: The human flea, _P. irritans_.

This image shows a close-up of the\nhead region; note a lack of genal and pronotal combs.

Adults are 1.5-4 mm long and laterally-\ncompressed. They lack both pronotal and genal combs (ctenidia). In females,\nthe dark-colored spermatheca is often visible.\n\n![](/dpdx/fleas/images/3/X_cheopis_BAM2.jpg?_=01938)\n\nFigure A: The Oriental rat flea, _Xenopsylla cheopis_.\n\n",
