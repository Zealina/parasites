  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nNematodes in the genus, _Trichostrongylus_. Although primarily parasites of\nanimals, several species of _Trichostrongylus_ have been known to infect\nhumans, including _T. orientalis_ , _T. colubriformis_ , and _T. axei_.\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n![Lifecycle](/dpdx/trichostrongylosis/modules/Trichostrongylus_LifeCycle.gif?_=96704)\n\nEggs are passed in the stool of the definitive host (usually a herbivorous\nmammal) ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/large_intestine_1.gif),\nand under favorable conditions (moisture, warmth, shade), larvae hatch within\nseveral days. The released rhabditiform larvae grow in the soil or on\nvegetationl ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_2.gif), and\nafter 5 to 10 days (and two molts) they become filariform (third-stage) larvae\nthat are infective ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_3.gif).\nInfection of the human host occurs upon ingestion of these filariform larvae\n![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/generic_4.gif). The\nlarvae reach the small intestine, where they reside and mature into adults.\nAdult worms inhabit the digestive tract of their definitive hosts and may\noccur as incidental infections in humans ![The number\n5](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/small_intestine_5.gif).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide, but more common where livestock is raised.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nMost infections are asymptomatic. Heavy infections can cause gastrointestinal\nproblems (abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia), headache, fatigue, anemia and\neosinophilia.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "#####  _Trichostrongylus_ spp. eggs in wet mounts.\n\nEggs of _Trichostrongylus_ spp. are thin-shelled, colorless and measure 75-95\nµm in length by 40-50 µm in width. Eggs taper at one end and the inner\nmembrane may be wrinkled. Eggs of _Trichostrongylus_ spp. are similar to\nhookworm eggs, but the eggs of the latter smaller at 60-75 µm long by 35-40 µm\nwide and have a shorter length:width ratio. Eggs are shed in feces.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichostrongylosis/images/1/Trichostrongylus_egg_wtmt_HB1.jpg?_=96715)\n\nFigure A: Egg of _Trichostrongylus_ sp. in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichostrongylosis/images/1/Trichostrongylus_egg_wtmt_HB2.jpg?_=96716)\n\nFigure B: Egg of _Trichostrongylus_ sp. in an unstained wet mount of stool.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichostrongylosis/images/1/Trichostrongylus_egg_wtmt_IN1.jpg?_=96714)\n\nFigure C: Egg of _Trichostrongylus_ sp. in an unstained wet mount of stool.\nImage courtesy of the Indiana State Department of Health.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichostrongylosis/images/1/Trichostrongylus_egg_wtmt_IN2.jpg?_=96713)\n\nFigure D: Egg of _Trichostrongylus_ sp. in an unstained wet mount of stool.\nImage courtesy of the Indiana State Department of Health.\n\n##### Trichostrongyle eggs in wet mounts.\n\nTrichostrongyles are common intestinal nematodes that infect herbivorous\ndomestic and wild animals worldwide; there are four important species in the\ngenus _Trichostrongylus_ that infect domestic animals _(Trichostrongylus axei_\n, _T. colubriformis_ , _T. vitrinus_ , and _T. capricola_). Determining a\ngenus and species without examining the morphology of the adult worm can be\nproblematic, particularly since trichostrongyle eggs can be difficult to\ndifferentiate from each other and from hookworm eggs. The following eggs could\nonly be described as generic trichostrongyle eggs.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichostrongylosis/images/2/Trichostrongylus_Netherlands_A.jpg?_=96718)\n\nFigure A: Egg of a _Trichostrongyle_ in an unstained wet mount of stool from a\npatient from Afghanistan.

In this egg, a developing larva can be observed.\n\n#####  _Trichostrongylus_ adults.\n\n_Trichostrongylus_ adults are long and slender. Females are 3-10 mm long by\n55-80 µm wide. Males are 2-8 mm long by 50-60 µm wide and possess a bursa.\nAdults reside in the small intestine of the definitive host.\n\n![](/dpdx/trichostrongylosis/images/3/Trichostrongylus_female_anterior_200x.jpg?_=96709)\n\nFigure A: Anterior end of a female _Trichostrongylus_ sp.

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs in feces is evidence of infection. Because\neggs may be difficult to find in light infections, a concentration or\nflotation procedure is recommended. Patients may have co-infections with\nhookworm, so care must be taken to differentiate the two.\n\n[Morphologic comparison with other intestinal\nparasites](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/stool/morphcomp.html)\n\n",
