  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agent\n\nCysticercosis is the disease associated with the development of the larval\nform (cysticercus) of the pork tapeworm, _Taenia solium,_ within an\nintermediate host. Swine are the usual intermediate host for _T. solium_ but\nhumans, the usual definitive host, can serve as accidental intermediate hosts\nfollowing ingestion of infectious eggs. Note that cysticercosis is only\nacquired from the fecal-oral route (ingestion of eggs)_,_**not** via the\ningestion of cysticerci in undercooked pork, which is associated with\n[intestinal taeniasis](/dpdx/taeniasis/index.html).\n\n### Life Cycle\n\n[![lifecycle](/dpdx/cysticercosis/modules/Cysticercosis_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=66535)](/dpdx/cysticercosis/modules/Cysticercosis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/cysticercosis/modules/Cysticercosis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n**Cysticercosis** is an infection of both humans and pigs with the larval\nstages of the parasitic cestode, _Taenia solium_. This infection is caused by\ningestion of eggs shed in the feces of a human tapeworm carrier\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) . These eggs are\nimmediately infectious and do not require a developmental period outside the\nhost. Pigs and humans become infected by ingesting eggs or gravid proglottids\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) ,\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/7.jpg) . Humans are usually\nexposed to eggs by ingestion of food/water contaminated with feces containing\nthese eggs or proglottids or by person-to-person spread. Tapeworm carriers can\nalso infect themselves through fecal-oral transmission (e.g. caused by poor\nhand hygiene). Once eggs or proglottids are ingested, oncospheres hatch in the\nintestine ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) ,\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/8.jpg) invade the intestinal\nwall, enter the bloodstream, and migrate to multiple tissues and organs where\nthey mature into cysticerci over 60–70 days\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) ,\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/9.jpg) . Some cysticerci will\nmigrate to the central nervous system, causing serious sequellae\n(neurocysticercosis).\n\nThis differs from**taeniasis** , which is an intestinal infection with the\nadult tapeworm. Humans acquire intestinal infections with _T. solium_ after\neating undercooked pork containing cysticerci\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Cysts evaginate and\nattach to the small intestine by their scolices. Adult tapeworms develop to\nmaturity and may reside in the small intestine for years\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) .\n\n### Hosts\n\nHumans are normal definitive host for _T. solium;_ cysticercosis results from\nhumans acting as accidental intermediate hosts for the parasite (this role is\nnormally fulfilled by swine).\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\n_Taenia solium_ is found nearly worldwide. Because pigs are intermediate hosts\nof the parasite, completion of the life cycle occurs in regions where humans\nlive in close contact with pigs and eat undercooked pork. Poor sanitation\nleading to environmental fecal contamination is a major factor in\ntransmission. Cysticercosis mainly affects low- and middle-income countries in\nAfrica, Asia (e.g., India, China, and Nepal) and Latin America (e.g.,\nGuatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador).\n\nIt is important to note that human cysticercosis is acquired by ingesting _T.\nsolium_ eggs shed in the feces of a human _T. solium_ tapeworm carrier (e.g.\non contaminated food items), and thus can still occur in populations that\nneither eat pork nor share environments with pigs, as long as the human\ncarrier is present.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe symptoms of cysticercosis vary depending upon the location and number of\ncysticerci. Cysticerci may develop in skeletal and heart muscle, skin,\nsubcutaneous tissues, the lungs, liver, and other tissues, including the oral\nmucosa. In most locations, cysticerci cause few symptoms and spontaneously\ndegenerate.\n\nCysticerci can migrate to the central nervous system and cause\nneurocysticercosis (NCC), which is associated with serious neurological and\nepileptic manifestations. Death can occur suddenly. NCC is typically divided\ninto parenchymal and extraparenchymal disease. Parenchymal NCC occurs when\ncysticerci develop within the brain tissue. Extraparynchymal NCC occurs when\ncysticerci develop in other parts of the nervous system, such as the\nsubarachnoid space, meninges, ventricles, spine, or eyes. A rare variant\ncalled “racemose cysticercosis” involves the development of cysts that are\nunusually large, multilobular, and clustered; they may lack a scolex. This\nform usually occurs in extraparenchymal sites (e.g., subarachnoid space,\nmeninges). Mixed parenchymal and extraparenchymal disease can occur.\n\n",
  "image_gallery": "**_Taenia solium_****cysticerci in tissue sections**\n\n_Taenia solium_ cysticerci (also called “cysticercus cellulosae”) are fluid-\nfilled cystic structures consisting of a thin bladder wall and parenchymatous\nportion containing a single invaginated scolex surrounded by a convoluted\nspiral canal. The hooks of the armed scolex may be visible in tissue sections.\nCysticerci are typically 5—15 mm long, but may reach up to 5 cm.\n\n![Figure A](/dpdx/cysticercosis/images/1/Cysticercus_A.jpg?_=70668)\n\nFigure A: Section of human brain tissue with a cysticercus (H&E stained).

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of neurocysticercosis involves a careful history and physical exam,\nneuroimaging studies (both a magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and a non-\ncontrast computed tomography [CT] scan of the brain), and serologic testing\nwith enzyme-linked immunotransfer blot. All patients strongly suspected of\nhaving cysticercosis or neurocysticercosis should have confirmatory testing by\nimmunoblot.\n\n#### Antibody Detection\n\nThe immunoblot assay based on _T. solium_ antigens is the test of choice for\nconfirming a clinical and radiologic presumptive diagnosis of cysticercosis\nand can be used to test both serum and/or CSF. Note that currently available\nantibody detection tests for cysticercosis do not distinguish between active\nand inactive infections and thus have not been useful in evaluating the\noutcomes and prognoses of medically treated patients.\n\n#### Antigen Detection\n\nAntigen testing is available at CDC in specific instances and after\nconsultation with CDC (Public Inquiries).\n\n#### Microscopic Diagnosis\n\nThe definitive diagnosis consists of demonstrating the cysticercus in the\ntissue involved. Cysticercosis can be diagnosed by the demonstration of larval\n_Taenia_ _solium_ cysts (cysticerci) in tissue sections.\n\n#### Laboratory Safety\n\nStandard safety precautions for the processing of tissue or serum samples\napply.\n\n",
