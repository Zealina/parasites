These fungi are found in\nthe lungs of mammals where they reside without causing overt infection until\nthe host’s immune system becomes debilitated. Then, an oftentimes lethal\npneumonia can result. Asexual phase: trophic forms ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/lungs_1.gif) replicate\nby mitosis ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/lungs_2.gif) to ![The\nnumber 3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/lungs_3.gif).\nSexual phase: haploid trophic forms conjugate ![The number\n1](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/lungs_1.gif) and produce\na zygote or sporocyte (early cyst) ![The number\n2](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/lungs_2.gif). The zygote\nundergoes meiosis and subsequent mitosis to produce eight haploid nuclei (late\nphase cyst) ![The number\n3](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/lungs_3.gif). Spores\nexhibit different shapes (such as, spherical and elongated forms). It is\npostulated that elongation of the spores precedes release from the spore case.\nIt is believed that the release occurs through a rent in the cell wall. After\nrelease, the empty spore case usually collapses, but retains some residual\ncytoplasm ![The number\n4](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/lungs_4.gif). A trophic\nstage, where the organisms probably multiply by binary fission is also\nrecognized to exist. The organism causes disease in immunosuppressed\nindividuals.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nWorldwide, in humans and animals. Serologic evidence indicates that most\nhealthy children have been exposed by age 3 to 4. _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia\n(PCP) occurs in immunosuppressed individuals and in premature, malnourished\ninfants.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe symptoms of _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia (PCP) include dyspnea, nonproductive\ncough, and fever. Chest radiography demonstrates bilateral infiltrates.\nExtrapulmonary lesions occur in a minority (<3%) of patients, involving most\nfrequently the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Typically, in\nuntreated PCP increasing pulmonary involvement leads to death.\n\n[ ](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/pneumocystis/index.html#)\n\n",

  "lab_diagnosis": "### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nThe specific diagnosis is based on identification of _P. jirovecii_ in\nbronchopulmonary secretions obtained as induced sputum or bronchoalveolar\nlavage (BAL) material. In situations where these two techniques cannot be\nused, transbronchial biopsy or open lung biopsy may prove necessary.\nMicroscopic identification of _P. jiroveci_ trophozoites and cysts is\nperformed with stains that demonstrate either the nuclei of trophozoites and\nintracystic stages (such as\n[Giemsa](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/other/BAL.html#Giemsa))\nor the cyst walls (such as the [silver\nstains](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diagnosticProcedures/other/BAL.html#Methanine)).\nIn addition, immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibodies can\nidentify the organisms with higher sensitivity than conventional microscopy.\n\n#### Molecular Diagnosis\n\n![Molecular diagnosis of Pneumocystis\njirovecii.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/images/pneumocystis/PneumocystisGel.jpg)\n\nAgarose gel (2%) analysis of PCR-amplified products from DNA extracted from a\nbroncho alveolar lavage (BAL) diagnostic specimen of a patient with pulmonary\nsymptoms.\n\nMolecular methods for detection of _P. jirovecii_ have shown very high\nsensitivity and specificity and constitute the gold standard for detection of\nthis pathogen.\n\nAgarose gel (2%) analysis of PCR-amplified products from DNA extracted from a\nbronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) diagnostic specimen of a patient with pulmonary\nsymptoms.\n\n  * **Lane S:** Molecular base pair standard (100-bp ladder).
