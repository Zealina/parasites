  "parasite_biology": "### Causal Agents\n\nThe microsporidia are a group of unicellular intracellular parasites closely\nrelated to fungi, although the nature of the relation to the kingdom Fungi is\nnot clear. The taxonomic position of this group has been debated and revised\nrepeatedly; historically, they were considered protozoa and often remain\nmanaged by diagnostic parasitology laboratories. Microsporidia are\ncharacterized by the production of resistant spores that vary in size (usually\n1—4 µm for medically-important species). They possess a unique organelle, the\npolar tubule or polar filament, which is coiled inside the spore as\ndemonstrated by its ultrastructure. Microsporidia also possess degenerated\nmitochondria called mitosomes and lack a conventional Golgi apparatus.\n\nTo date, more than 1400 species belonging to over 200 genera have been\ndescribed as parasites infecting a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate\nhosts. There are at least 15 microsporidian species that have been identified\nas human pathogens; the vast majority of cases being caused by\n**_Enterocytozoon bieneusi,_** followed by some **_Encephalitozoon_** species\n(_E. cuniculi,_ _E. hellem_ , _E. intestinalis_(_=Septata intestinalis_)).\nOther less frequently reported agents include members of the genera\n**_Anncaliia_** (=_Brachiola_) (_A. algerae_ , _A. connori, A. vesicularum_),\n**_Microsporidium_** (_M_. _ceylonensis_ , _M. africanum_),\n**_Trachipleistophora_** (_T. hominis, T. anthropophthera_),_**Nosema\nocularum**_ ,_**Pleistophora**_**_ronneafiei_** , **_Vittaforma corneae_**\n(=_Nosema corneae_), **_Tubulinosema acridophagus_** , and an unknown species\nlikely belonging to **_Endoreticulatus_**.\n\n###  Life Cycle\n\n[![Lifecycle](/dpdx/microsporidiosis/modules/Microsporidia_LifeCycle_19.jpg?_=36616)](/dpdx/microsporidiosis/modules/Microsporidia_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\n[View Larger](/dpdx/microsporidiosis/modules/Microsporidia_LifeCycle_lg.jpg)\n\nThe infective form of microsporidia is the resistant spore, which can persist\nin the environment for months\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/1.jpg) The spore then germinates,\nrapidly everting its polar tubule which contacts the eukaryotic host cell\nmembrane ![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/2.jpg) . The spore then\ninjects the infective sporoplasm into the host cell through the polar tubule\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/3.jpg) . Inside the cell, the\nsporoplasm enters the proliferative phase marked by extensive multiplication\nvia merogony (binary fission or multiple fission), creating meronts\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/4.jpg) . The location of this\ndevelopmental stage within the host cell varies by genus; it can occur either\nin direct contact with the host cell cytosol (_Enterocytozoon, Nosema_),\ninside a parasitophorous vacuole of unknown origin (_Encephalitozoon_), in a\nparasite-secreted envelope (_Pleistophora, Trachipleistophora_), or surrounded\nby the host cell endoplasmic reticulum (_Endoreticulatus, Vittaforma_)\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/5.jpg) . Following the\nproliferative phase, meronts undergo sporogony in which the thick spore wall\nand invasion apparatus develop, creating sporonts and eventually mature spores\nwhen all organelles are polarized. When the spores increase in number and\ncompletely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell membrane is disrupted and\nspores are released to the surroundings\n![image](/dpdx/images/life_cycle_numbers/new/6.jpg) . These free mature spores\ncan infect new cells thus continuing the cycle.\n\nMature spores of intestinal-localizing species may be shed in feces, although\nthe route of transmission remains uncertain for many species. Exposure to\nspores in water or in soil appears to be a potentially major route, based on\nthe finding of spores in these sources along with case histories. _E.\nbieneusi_ and _V. corneae_ have been identified in surface waters, and spores\nof _Nosema_ sp. (and likely _A. algerae_) have been identified in ditch water.\nCases of donor-derived microsporidiosis (_Encephalitozoon cuniculi_) following\nbone marrow, kidney, liver, and heart transplantation have been confirmed.\n\n### Hosts\n\nMany domestic and wild animals may be naturally infected with various\nmedically-important microsporidia. _Enterocytozoon bieneusi_ is generally\nconsidered a human parasite, but has been detected in swine, primates, cattle,\ncats, dogs, and several other mammals. Some, but not all, of these animal-\nderived strains appear to represent zoonotic genotypes.\n\n_Encephalitozoon cuniculi_ is endemic in several captive and wild rabbit\npopulations. It has also occasionally been found in domestic dogs, cats,\nfoxes, captive monkeys, and mink. Birds, especially psittacines (parrots,\nparakeets, love birds, budgerigars, etc.), may represent reservoirs for\n_Encephalitozoon hellem_. Unlike the other two important members of the genus,\n_E. intestinalis_ is only rarely identified in animals other than humans.\n\nThe host range of the other microsporidia known to infect humans is not as\nwell known. No animal reservoir has been identified for _Vittaforma\ncornea.__Pleistophora_ spp. are found in fish and reptiles, but spore\nmorphology in these species is inconsistent with that of the species\nimplicated in human infections (_P. ronneafiei_)._Tubulinosema acridophagus,_\n_Trachipleistophora_ spp., and _Anncaliia algerae_ are related to known insect\nparasites, however, the significance of insects in transmission is unclear.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nMicrosporidia are being increasingly recognized as opportunistic infectious\nagents worldwide. Efforts to characterize the global distribution of species\nand genotypes are ongoing.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nHuman microsporidiosis represents an important and rapidly emerging\nopportunistic disease. Historically it has been observed in severely\nimmunocompromised persons, particularly among persons with AIDS, however the\nimplementation of effective anti-retroviral therapies has reduced the\nincidence in this group considerably. Cases are also known to occur in\nimmunocompetent individuals. The clinical manifestations of microsporidiosis\nare very diverse, varying according to the causal species and route of\ninfection. Disseminated infection can be fatal. Of all of the manifestations\nof microsporidiosis, _Enterocytozoon bieneusi-_ associated diarrhea is the\nmost common. Below is a table summarizing the typical sites of infection for\nvarious species:\n\nSpecies | Known sites of localization  \n---|---  \n_Anncaliia algerae_ | Eyes, muscle  \n_Anncaliia connori_ | Systemic  \n_Anncaliia vesicularum_ | Muscle  \n_Encephalitozoon cuniculi_ | Systemic  \n_Encephalitozoon hellem_ | Eyes  \n_Encephalitozoon intestinalis_ | Small intestine  \n_Enterocytozoon bieneusi_ | Small intestine, biliary tree  \n_Microsporidium_ spp. | Eyes  \n_Nosema ocularum_ | Eyes  \n_Pleistophora ronneafiei_ | Muscle  \n_Trachipleistophora anthropopthera_ | Systemic  \n_Trachipleistophora hominis_ | Eyes, muscle  \n_Tubulinosema acridophagus_ | Systemic  \n_Vittaforma corneae_ | Eyes  \n  \nAdapted from: Han, B. and Weiss, L.M., 2017.

  "lab_diagnosis": "#### Microscopy\n\nLight microscopic examination of the stained clinical smears, especially the\nfecal samples, is an inexpensive method of diagnosing microsporidial\ninfections even though it does not allow identification of microsporidia to\nthe species level. The most widely used staining technique is the Chromotrope\n2R method or its modifications. This technique stains the spore and the spore\nwall a bright pinkish red. Often, a darker-staining equatorial band is seen in\nthe middle of the spore. This technique, however, is lengthy and time\nconsuming and requires about 90 min. A recently developed “Quick-Hot Gram\nChromotrope technique” however, cuts down the staining time to less than 10\nmin and provides a good differentiation from the lightly stained background\nfecal materials so that the spores stand out for easy visualization. The\nspores stain dark violet and the equatorial band is enhanced. In some cases\ndark staining Gram positive granules are also clearly seen. Chemofluorescent\nagents such as Calcofluor white are also useful in the quick identification of\nspores in fecal smears. The spores measure from 0.8 to 1.4 µm in the case of\n_Enterocytozoon bieneusi_ , and 1.5 to 4 µm in _Anncaliia algerae_ ,\n_Encephalitozoon_ spp., _Vittaforma corneae_ , and _Nosema_ spp.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) is still the gold standard and is\nnecessary for the identification of the microsporidian species, which is based\non internal features of the spore such as the number of polar tubule coils.\nHowever, TEM is expensive, time consuming, and not feasible for routine\ndiagnosis.\n\n#### Immunofluorescence Assays (IFA)\n\nIFAs are available for microsporidia using monoclonal and/or polyclonal\nantibodies.\n\n#### Molecular Methods (PCR)\n\nThe CDC offers molecular identification of _Enterocytozoon bieneusi_ ,\n_Encephalitozoon intestinalis_ , _Encephalitozoon hellem_ and _Encephalitozoon\ncuniculi_ using species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays.\nMolecular identification of other microsporidia species can be attempted using\ngenera-specific primers and sequencing analysis on a case-by-case basis.\n\n#### Diagnostic References:\n\nDa Silva, A.J., Schwartz, D.A., Visvesvara, G.S., De Moura, H., Slemenda, S.B.\nand Pieniazek, N.J., 1996.
